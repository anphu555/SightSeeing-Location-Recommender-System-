The living quarters and work rooms are elevated above the ground; all posts, beams and braces are made of wood, and the roof is thatched with trung quan leaves. Underground shelters are typically placed next to the housing and work areas, sinking deep into the earth.|||Currently, this site is planned into two main zones:|||- Historic site: restored main residence, a large hall, a small hall, guard house, office, Hoang Cam kitchen, and the living and working quarters of comrades Nguyen Van Linh, Nguyen Chi Thanh, Vo Van Kiet, Pham Hung, among others. The combat trench network, including the distinctive frog-shaped trenches, runs continuously along the whole route.|||- The memorial complex includes a reception hall, exhibition area, and a shrine honoring heroic martyrs. The total built area of this zone is 750m2.|||2. Base of the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|||On December 20, 1960, at Trảng Chiêng in Tân Lập commune, Chau Thành district (now Tân Biên district, Tây Ninh province), the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam was founded and a provisional Central Committee was appointed. The Front later held a series of national congresses:|||The first National Liberation Front of South Vietnam Representative Congress (February 16 – March 3, 1962) and the second (November 11–18, 1964).|||- From 15 to 20 August 1967, in the North Tây Ninh base area, the irregular congress of the Front adopted a political program as the basis for establishing the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam. This was the third and final congress.|||This historic site is located along the Cho Stream and consists of three distinct functional zones:|||- The original historic site includes: the guard house, the liaison house, the guest house, the residences of comrades Nguyen Huu Tho, Phung Van Cung, Vo Chi Cong, the Hoang Cam kitchen, an assembly hall, and several sections of trench roads and shelter tunnels…;|||- The memorial complex includes a gatehouse, a reception hall, and an exhibition hall;|||- Protected area: integrated with the natural landscape.|||3. Provisional Revolutionary Government Headquarters of the Republic of South Vietnam|||From 6-8 June 1969, in the Tan Not forest of Chau Thanh district (now Tan Bien district, Tay Ninh province), the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam was formed. Architect Huynh Tan Phat served as its chairman, and lawyer Nguyen Huu Tho chaired the Advisory Council.|||The Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam headquarters, covering 60ha, is divided into three zones:|||- The original historic complex comprises the workhouse, dining hall, Hoang Cam kitchen, shelter bunker, and trench communications.|||- The complex includes a reception building, exhibition space, guest lounge, workroom, and a brewery;|||- Protected area: integrated with natural landscape.|||The historic site of the Southern Central Committee Base holds special significance. Over 15 years (1961-1975), the Central Committee turned many Party policies and President Ho Chi Minh’s directives into concrete actions in the South, issuing numerous directives and resolutions that shaped the revolutionary strategy across the southern battlefield. History shows that establishing the Southern Central Committee Base was a wise and innovative Party decision. The Base left valuable lessons on building strong bases, mobilizing the people in revolutionary movements, and especially on Party building.|||The Southern Central Headquarters, once the revolutionary capital of South Vietnam, preserves the traces and memories of a grueling, sacrificial yet proud revolutionary struggle. It bears witness to senior Party leaders, countless officials and soldiers who fought in the holy war to liberate the nation from American aggression, especially in the Southern battlefields. This historic site is not only vital for preserving tradition and education, but also an attractive destination for both domestic and international visitors, particularly Vietnam’s younger generations.|||Recognizing its special significance, on May 10, 2012 the Prime Minister classified the Southern Regional Central Headquarters site as a Special National Historical Monument (Decision No. 548/QD‑TTG).","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/TayNinh/Tay-Ninh--Tham-quan-can-cu-trung-uong-cuc-mien-Nam-2.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/TayNinh/Tay-Ninh--Tham-quan-can-cu-trung-uong-cuc-mien-Nam-1.jpg"

The flood season runs from August to November (lunar calendar), coinciding with the central‑Vietnam rainy season.|||When the waters rise, many birds return to build nests and feed on the plentiful fish. This time also brings a bounty of riverine specialties. Lotus and water lily blossoms cover the village, providing spectacular photo opportunities.|||Tan Lap is ideal for nature lovers seeking peace. Entrance is 60,000 VND per person; boat rides with a guide cost an additional 30,000 VND per person. Boat operators double as guides, steering you through the vast marshes and lush vegetation. In October‑November, when lotus are in full bloom, boats can take you to the stunning lotus fields for unforgettable selfies.|||Tan Lap remains a relatively untouched destination, so culinary options are modest. Simple, rustic river‑front dishes are available, and visitors may bring their own food for a communal picnic.

The locals admired and revered him, calling him Thay An (meaning 'Peaceful Master'), and the mountain was named after him as Thay An Mountain.

The name 'Bân' signifies a beautiful and complete mountain, both inside and out, with the Mân River flowing through it, earning it the local name 'Mân' or 'Mằn' due to a pronunciation variation.|||The Man Mountain scenic complex is steeped in thousands of years of history and legend, reflecting the deep cultural and spiritual life of the local people through stories like the giant who shouldered rocks to mend the sky, the sacred Bạch Thạch temple, the origins of the quýt lú garden, the story of the mountain with a mouth, and the tales of Ông Cộc, Ông Loang, and Ông Dài. Notably, Man Mountain was a crucial military location in the feudal era, serving as a signal reception and transmission point from Bài Thơ Mountain and Xích Thổ (Nhà Mạc) Citadel for offensive and defensive strategies, especially during the Trịnh-Mạc conflict in the northeastern region.|||Man Mountain is situated between two streams, the Đá Trắng (Bạch Thạch Khe) and the Lưỡng Kỳ (Khe Bân), which flow into the Đá Trắng River, creating a breathtaking landscape with lush vegetation and a unique harmony of mountain and water. This is also the most beautiful limestone mountain, uniquely preserved in the Cửa Lục Gulf area, part of the Ha Long Bay World Heritage site.|||Man Mountain exemplifies the limestone mountain system of Hoành Bồ District, standing over 400m above sea level with steep cliffs, treacherous gorges, and a varied landscape of square, round, smooth, and pointed formations, resembling a kneeling elephant with its trunk bowed towards the Khe Bân stream.|||At the foot of Man Mountain, the Bạch Thạch Temple was built by locals to worship various deities, including Cao Sơn Thượng Đẳng thần, Quý Minh Thượng Đẳng thần, Đại Càn Quốc gia Nam hải, and Đệ nhị Long Vương thượng đẳng thần. In addition to the deities worshiped at Bạch Thạch Temple, Hoành Bồ District is home to a system of temples and shrines related to Man Mountain and Bạch Thạch Temple, scattered across Thống Nhất Commune, Đồng Lâm Commune, and Trới Town, including the shrines of Ông Cộc, Ông Loang, Ông Dài, Thánh Mẫu Shrine, and Xích Thổ Temple. These shrines are closely linked to Bạch Thạch Temple and Man Mountain through captivating legends and divine stories, leaving behind three shrines that worship the three sons of the Man Mountain deity (Ông Cộc, Ông Loang, Ông Dài).|||The shrines of Ông Cộc (Trới Town, Zone 9), Ông Loang (Cài Village, Đồng Lâm Commune), and Ông Dài are located at the confluence of the Bạch Thạch and Bân streams before they flow into the Cửa Lục River.|||Beyond its natural beauty, Man Mountain holds significant cultural and spiritual value. It is connected to the legend of 'The Giant Who Shouldered Rocks to Mend the Sky'.",""
