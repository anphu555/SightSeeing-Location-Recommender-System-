1,Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy,"The Temple of Literature was built in 1070 (the second year of Than Vu era under Emperor Ly Thanh Tong's reign) to worship the ancient sages and masters of Confucianism, and also functioned as a royal school whose first student was Prince Ly Can Duc, son of Emperor Ly Thanh Tong. In 1076, Emperor Ly Nhan Tong established the Imperial Academy next to the Temple of Literature as a school exclusively for the king's children and the children of high-ranking mandarins in the court. In 1253, Emperor Tran Thai Tong changed the Imperial Academy to the National College, expanding it to admit children of commoners with excellent academic abilities. During Emperor Tran Minh Tong's reign (1314 – 1329), educator Chu Van An was appointed as the Rector of the Imperial Academy and a direct teacher for the princes. In 1370, after his death, Emperor Tran Nghe Tong ordered him to be worshipped at the Temple of Literature alongside Confucius. In 1785, Emperor Le Hien Tong changed the Imperial Academy to the Imperial College. By the early Nguyen Dynasty, the Imperial Academy was established in Hue, and the Imperial College was renamed Khai Thanh House. From the outside, the entire Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy complex is surrounded on all four sides by a large brick wall built with oversized 'vo' bricks – a common architectural material during the Later Le Dynasty, creating an ancient, solemn, and nostalgic space. Inside the wall, ancient architectural roofs are hidden under the lush foliage of old trees, giving the place a completely different scenery from the outside, attracting visitors. In front of the Temple of Literature, across Quoc Tu Giam Street, there is a rather wide lake called Lake Van. Previously, in the middle of the lake was Kim Chau mound, on which a square pavilion - 'Phan Thuy Pavilion' - was built, where Confucian scholars held poetry discussions. Today, the pavilion is gone, but on the mound there is still a stele erected in the 18th year of Tu Duc (1865) recording the renovation of the Temple of Literature. Located within a large campus, the inner self of the Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy is divided into 5 areas, separated by ancient brick walls. The first area starts from the Temple of Literature Gate to Dai Trung Gate. Before entering the Temple of Literature Gate, visitors must pass through the Outer Ceremonial Gate consisting of 4 large brick pillars (four pillars), where the two central pillars are built higher, topped with two kneeling Nghê statues; the two outer pillars are lower, topped with phoenix figures, with their tails gathered together and 4 heads facing 4 directions. The pillar bodies are embossed with Han script couplets. On both sides of the ceremonial gate are 2 'Dismounting' steles. Passing through the Outer Ceremonial Gate, visitors will go straight to the Temple of Literature Gate (Inner Ceremonial Gate) consisting of 3 arched entrances, with the main central gate built with 2 floors. The lower floor is designed to be large and wide, with stairs leading to the upper floor. On the outside, the lower floor only opens one arched entrance, with two wooden wings, and the archway is shaped like a semicircle, embossed with a pair of dragons adoring the moon. The upper floor is smaller, designed as a 2-story, 8-roof ceremonial gate, including 4 eaves and 4 ridge roofs. This floor opens 3 arched entrances, the central one has a bell and chime hanging, surrounded by a wide corridor, with railings on all 4 sides. From the Temple of Literature Gate, along a straight brick-paved path, visitors will reach the second gate, Dai Trung Gate, consisting of 3 bays built on a high brick foundation, with tiled roofs and a three-row column structure. On both sides are 2 smaller gates: Thanh Duc Gate and Dai Tai Gate. The horizontal wall connecting the 3 gates of Dai Trung Gate extends outwards on both sides to the external surrounding wall, together with the horizontal wall at the Temple of Literature Gate, forming a square frame with many green trees and shade inside, giving visitors a sense of relaxation when strolling in this solemn and tranquil place. The brick-paved path from the Temple of Literature Gate will continue to lead visitors to the second area, from Dai Trung Gate to Khue Van Cac. Built in 1805, Khue Van Cac is a square pavilion consisting of 2 floors and 8 roofs. The lower floor consists of 4 brick pillars, open on all 4 sides. The upper floor has a wooden structure, tiled roof, with wooden panels on all 4 sides, each side having a circular window, with decorative bars symbolizing the rays of the Khue constellation shining in the sky. On both sides of Khue Van Cac are two gates, Bi Van Gate and Suc Van Gate – names that praise the beauty and value of literature. Khue Van Cac is considered a unique architectural work, a symbol of Vietnamese culture and literature. Stepping past Khue Van Cac, visitors will reach the third area in the Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy complex, which is Thien Quang Well and the system of Doctorate Steles. Thien Quang Well (Thien Quang spring), also known as Van Tri Lake (Lake of Literature), is square-shaped and full of water year-round. The calm water surface becomes a mirror reflecting Khue Van Cac and the ancient trees, creating a shimmering and magical scene. The ancients believed that the square well symbolized the earth, and the circular window of Khue Van Cac symbolized the sky. The essence of both heaven and earth is concentrated in this majestic cultural and educational center in the capital city. The brick-paved path surrounding Thien Quang Well will lead visitors to the House of Doctorate Steles, erected on both the left and right sides of the well. This is considered a historically important relic in the Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy complex, comprising 82 stone steles carved with epitaphs recording the names of Vietnamese Confucian Doctors from the Imperial examinations during the Later Le and Mac Dynasties (1442-1779). All steles were crafted in the same style: flat, with a curved forehead and an arched shape. The steles are placed on the backs of turtles to symbolize the longevity of the nation's essence, reflecting the cultural and historical values of the country over more than 300 years. This is an invaluable historical source for future generations to research the lives and careers of many Vietnamese celebrities. With their outstanding and rare values, in 2010, 82 stone steles of the Doctorate examinations of the Later Le and Mac dynasties at the Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy were recognized as World Documentary Heritage under UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme. After visiting the House of Doctorate Steles, passing through Dai Thanh Gate, visitors will arrive at a large, Bat Trang brick-paved courtyard, marking the beginning of the fourth area, the main area of the Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy. On the left and right sides of the courtyard are two rows of buildings, Ta Vu (Left Chamber) and Huu Vu (Right Chamber), each consisting of 9 bays, built on a high foundation with traditional tiled roofs, a 'bo dinh' ridge style, and a 'chong ruong' truss structure. Connecting to the gables of the two Ta Vu and Huu Vu buildings, forming a traditional U-shaped structure, is the Dai Bai Hall, where in the past, twice a year in spring and autumn, the king, royal family members, and mandarins came to offer sacrifices to Confucius. The Dai Bai Hall consists of 9 bays with 6 rows of columns, built on a foundation 30cm higher than the courtyard surface, with brick borders around the foundation and tiled roofs. The truss sets are structured in a 'chong ruong, con ke chong, bay hien' style, with a prominent 'luong long chau nguyet' (two dragons adoring the moon) motif on the central ridge, and stylized floral decorations on the eaves. Currently, only the central bay of the Dai Bai Hall has an altar, while the other bays are empty. Around the altar hang many horizontal plaques and couplets praising Confucianism and its wise scholars. Parallel to the Dai Bai Hall at the back is the Dai Thanh Hall, consisting of 9 bays, with walls on 3 sides. The front has a fixed five-bay folding door, and the four gable bays have fixed lattice windows. The central bay of the hall houses a shrine and a large throne dedicated to Confucius. The fifth area in the Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy complex is the Imperial College, formerly the Imperial Academy, where talents were trained for successive dynasties. Over time and historical events, the old building was destroyed. In 1999, the Imperial College was rebuilt with a grand architectural scale, harmonizing with the landscape of the Temple of Literature in front. The Imperial College has an interconnected structure, with tiled roofs, a 'chong ruong, con chong ke, bay hien' truss system, and Bat Trang brick floors. The sanctuary at the back is built in a double-tiered roof style, with tiled roofs and a 'chong ruong gia chieng' truss structure. The final architectural section includes the Front Hall and Rear Hall, rebuilt in 1999. The Front Hall has 9 bays with 40 ironwood columns supporting the roof, and brick walls at the gables. This is currently where documents displaying the tradition of studiousness, respect for teachers, and reverence for morality of Vietnamese generations are exhibited. The Front Hall connects to the Rear Hall via a corridor, with two doors leading to the bell house and drum house. The Rear Hall is a two-story wooden structure, in which the 1st floor consists of 9 bays and 2 side wings with 72 ironwood columns, honoring the Distinguished Master and Rector of the Imperial Academy Chu Van An – a world cultural celebrity, an eminent Vietnamese educator, and displaying documents about the Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy as well as Vietnamese Confucian education. The 2nd floor is dedicated to the kings who contributed to building the Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy and the cause of Confucian education of the nation: Emperor Ly Thanh Tong, Ly Nhan Tong, and Le Thanh Tong. Currently, the Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy is also a venue for typical cultural activities such as scientific workshops, specialized exhibitions; honoring outstanding valedictorians graduating from universities and academies in Hanoi; awarding certificates of Professor and Associate Professor academic titles; or organizing annual Book Fairs and Vietnam Poetry Day events.",https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG18JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG17JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG16JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG15JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG14JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG13JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG12JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG11JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG10JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG09JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG08JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG07JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG06JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG05JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG04.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG03JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG02.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG01JPG.jpg
