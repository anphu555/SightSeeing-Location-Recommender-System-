Therefore, the pagoda was built on a large land area, with an architectural design that ensured sufficient living space for the monastic community.|||During the Ly Dynasty, the temple was relatively unknown.|||By the Tran Dynasty, after Tran Nhan Tong founded the Truc Lam Yen Tu Buddhist sect and promoted Buddhism in society, Vinh Nghiem Temple, as a major center for the sect, had a significant impact not only on the Buddhist community but also across various aspects of society.|||All three patriarchs (Tran Nhan Tong, Phap Loa, and Huyen Quang) used Vinh Nghiem Temple as the center to propagate the Buddhism of the Truc Lam Yen Tu sect, which continued to develop after the Tran dynasty.|||For nearly 800 years, the Truc Lam Yen Tu Buddhist sect has gone through many ups and downs, closely linked to the ups and downs of Vietnamese history, but it is still maintained and developed. From the Vinh Nghiem Buddhist center, the ideology of this sect spread throughout the country and to the region and the world.|||Vinh Nghiem Pagoda is considered the most important historical site of Buddhism in Vietnam, especially for the Truc Lam Yen Tu Buddhist sect. It is regarded as the first Buddhist university in Vietnam and is considered the ancestral site of Vinh Nghiem. Researchers consider it a ""Museum of Mahayana Buddhist Culture"".|||In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Vinh Nghiem Pagoda was a major publishing center for Vietnamese Buddhism. The woodblock repository preserved here contains 34 book titles with nearly 3,000 engraved blocks, each with two sides, and each side has 2 pages (negative images) with around 2,000 Nom and Han characters.|||This is the only original set of woodblocks of the Truc Lam Buddhist sect still preserved at Vinh Nghiem Pagoda, used to spread the core teachings of Buddhism to hundreds of pagodas with millions of monks and Buddhists over time.|||With its scientific and historical significance, the Moc Ban of Vinh Nghiem Pagoda was recognized by UNESCO as a Memory of the World in the Asia-Pacific region in 2012.|||Unique Artistic Architectural Work|||After nearly a thousand years with many renovations, the current architectural complex of Vinh Nghiem Pagoda is a product of the Le Trung Hung and Nguyen dynasties. To meet the needs of worship and training Buddhist monks nationwide, Vinh Nghiem Pagoda was built on a large scale. The architectural clusters are arranged in a rectangular space, spread along a longitudinal axis and in order from south to north, forming five main architectural complexes: Tam Quan gate, Tam Bao hall, First Ancestor Hall, Bell Tower, Second Ancestor Hall.|||Tam quan: The Tam quan gate of Vinh Nghiem Pagoda is a wooden architectural structure built in the overlapping style, consisting of 1 compartment and 2 wings with 2 floors and 8 curved roofs. The ridge is built with bricks and covered with mortar, with a figure of two dragons facing the moon. The architectural design symbolizes three elements of Buddhist philosophy: Falsehood, Emptiness, and Reality. Passing through this Tam quan gate means entering a meditative state, where one is blessed by Buddha to achieve a calm and serene mind. This architectural structure was rebuilt in 1993-1994.|||Tam Bao: A complex of three Buddhist structures following the Mahayana tradition, characterized by multiple Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and practitioners. The wooden architectural components include the front hall, Thiêu huong, and Upper Hall, forming a single unit. The layout is in the cong shape, with a spacious design, seven-boat-shaped roof beams, leaf-shaped decorations, four curved roofs, and eight rafters.|||is removed and the sentence is broken into clear English sentences: The complex consists of three main parts: the front hall, Thiêu huong, and Upper Hall. These structures are arranged in a cong shape.|||The outermost house is the front hall, consisting of 5 bays and 2 wings; the structure of the beams follows the traditional style, with intricate carvings. Connecting the front hall to the upper hall is the Thiêu hương house, which has 3 bays and a similar beam structure. The upper hall, located innermost, also has 3 bays and is constructed in the same style, with smooth and sturdy wooden panels.|||The Tam Bao Tower preserves three treasures of the Buddhist realm: the Buddha treasure, the Dharma treasure, and the Sangha treasure.|||The Buddha treasure refers to revered statues worshipped and honored throughout the year. The Dharma treasure includes scriptures and texts related to Buddhism. The Sangha treasure represents monks devoted to Buddhist practices, serving as a connection between Buddha and sentient beings. These three treasures are carefully preserved by the people, with the mindset of only adding to their beauty and value, never taking away.|||It is believed that losing a Buddhist treasure will result in a tenfold loss, so even if someone takes it unintentionally, they will feel remorse and return it, repenting for the rest of their life.|||A very special feature at the Tam Bao tower is the rammed earth floor, which has been preserved for a long time, a rare feature among ancient Vietnamese temples. The rammed earth floor is significant in Buddhism as it represents the harmony of yin and yang.|||Upon entering the Tam Bao temple, everyone will feel the refreshing and serene atmosphere that brings peace to the soul. The arrangement of Buddha statues, plaques, couplets, and worship items creates a truly sacred and solemn ambiance, fitting for a Buddhist setting. Visitors from all directions bow reverently and light incense sticks as an offering to the Buddhas, expressing their devotion. They also pledge to contribute their limited resources to help build and beautify this sacred site.|||First Ancestor House: This is where the three patriarchs of the Trúc Lâm Yên Tử Buddhist sect are worshiped: King Tran Nhan Tong, Master Pháp Loa, and Master Huyen Quang. The layout is arranged in the cong shape, characteristic of the Le Trung Hung architecture (18th century). It consists of a 3-bay front hall, a 2-bay connecting hall, and a 1-bay rear shrine, with a 4-roof structure; the foundation is not large but is quite imposing and solemn.|||The first Ancestor House is made with wooden roof structures in the style of ke chuyen gia chieng and ke chuyen doc tru. It has minimal intricate carvings, mostly plain and joined with mortise and tenon. With this house, Vinh Nghiem Temple becomes a temple with the most distinctively Vietnamese Buddhist architecture among ancient temples in the North.|||In Bac Giang, large pagodas typically have a house for the patriarch behind the Tam Bao hall. However, this patriarch's house in most pagodas only has an idol of the first patriarch or just an image of Bodhidharma, not the Three Patriarchs of Trúc Lâm. This is the difference that is unique to Vinh Nghiem Pagoda, unlike other pagodas in Bac Giang province in particular and the northeastern region of North Vietnam in general.|||Bell tower: A two-story structure behind the first house, with ""upper thu, lower trai"" architecture in the Nguyen style (19th century). The upper floor has a wooden floor, with a large bell cast in 1830 hung in the middle, used by monks to toll the bell for Buddhist teachings.|||This is a beautiful architectural work with intricate carvings and a harmonious combination of wood and tile materials.|||Second Ancestor House: Located behind the Bell Tower, the layout is in the shape of the character ""nhị"", consisting of 11 bays of the worship hall running parallel to 3 bays of the sanctum. They are connected by a gutter, which is the flow of the roof behind the worship hall and the front roof of the sanctum. Built during the Le - Nguyen period, it is where the statues, altars, or photos of the patriarchs who succeeded the three founding patriarchs of the Truc Lam Yen Tu Zen sect are placed.|||This description was broken into two sentences to improve clarity, but the original ""|||"" separator is maintained for the sake of the original instruction, even though there's only one sentence now.|||Corridor: along the sides of the above buildings are two corridors, also where visitors sit and rest. Here, there are no statues of Arhat like other temples, which is also a difference from other ancient temples in Bac Giang.|||It is notable that Vinh Nghiem Pagoda bears the strong identity of Vietnamese Buddhist culture in that it has two separate ancestral worship halls following the Truc Lam Yen Tu Zen sect, without worshiping Bodhidharma. The architectural layout also reveals that the ancient monks followed Buddhism but still valued Indian Buddhism and the Mahayana sect that was introduced to our country. This is reflected in the first building, the Tam Bao hall, which faces a large open space in front.|||Thus, Vinh Nghiem Pagoda has both 18th and 19th century architectural styles, making it a diverse and exemplary site for studying Vietnam's traditional architecture. The Buddha statue system at Vinh Nghiem Pagoda is relatively complete in terms of form, position, hierarchy, and function, and is considered beautiful works of art in Vietnam's Buddhist sculpture heritage. The round sculptures at Vinh Nghiem Pagoda hold a special position in terms of artistic value, representing the Nguyen period.|||The system of Buddha statues is very large in number, rich in posture, proportion, and diverse in expression. The sculpture art is standard in terms of proportion, described in a conventional Buddhist style. The greatest value of Vinh Nghiem Pagoda's architecture lies in its spatial landscape with a beautiful feng shui location and the connection between various architectural components, creating a grand hundred-room pagoda complex, affirming its role as a Trúc Lâm Yên Tử Buddhist center.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/BacGiang/ChuaVinhNghiem/VinhNghiemPagoda8.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/BacGiang/ChuaVinhNghiem/VinhNghiemPagoda7.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/BacGiang/ChuaVinhNghiem/VinhNghiemPagoda5.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/BacGiang/ChuaVinhNghiem/VinhNghiemPagoda4.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/BacGiang/ChuaVinhNghiem/VinhNghiemPagoda3.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/BacGiang/ChuaVinhNghiem/VinhNghiemPagoda2.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/BacGiang/ChuaVinhNghiem/VinhNghiemPagoda1.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/BacGiang/ChuaVinhNghiem/VinhNghiemPagoda6.jpg"

In 1775, the Tay Son dynasty rebuilt and expanded it to 15 miles to the east. It was officially named Thanh Hoang De in 1778.|||Hoang De Citadel is not large but has its own unique beauty, particularly with its Cham architecture, featuring three layers: the inner, outer, and Forbidden City. The outer citadel is the outermost layer, rectangular but with wavy edges, not straight, with a circumference of 7400m. The base is over 10m wide, the wall is over 6m high, and the top is over 4m wide. The citadel has 5 gates. The southern wall has two gates, Ve gate and Tan Khai gate. The other three walls have one gate each: East, West, and North. The wall is made of earth with laterite stone on both sides. The inner citadel, also known as Hoang Thanh, is built southwest of the outer citadel, with a circumference of 1600m and a base width of 7-9m. The wall is also made of earth with laterite stone on both sides.

Unable to withstand the Tay Son army, Vo Tan set himself on fire, and civil official Ngo Tung Chau took poison. After the Tay Son dynasty collapsed in 1802, Hoang De citadel was flattened by the Nguyen dynasty. On the site of the Bat Giac palace, where King Thai Duc held court, Nguyen Anh built a tomb and an octagonal pavilion to worship defeated generals Vo Tan and Ngo Tung Chau.|||With a history of hundreds of years, the ancient Hoang De citadel is like an old, forgotten book.

Soon after, a golden turtle appeared, claiming to be the Kim Quy god, buried the egg, and tasked the old man with protecting the offspring of the Dragon King. The egg grew larger, rising high, occupying a large area of land. The eggshell shone with colors: blue, red, white, yellow, purple, sparkling like a giant brick. One day, the old man dozed off and heard a fire breaking out. He called for help, using the turtle's claw, a gift from the Kim Quy god. Inside the egg, a spacious, cool cave appeared. He fell asleep, unaware of a miracle: a beautiful girl emerged from the egg, and where he lay was one of the five marble rocks formed from the eggshell fragments...”.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/DaNang/Nguhanhson/Nguhanhson2.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/DaNang/Nguhanhson/Nguhanhson1.jpg"

"24","Ngoc Son Temple","Location: Situated on Ngoc Son Island in Hoan Kiem Lake, Hanoi city.|||Characteristics: Although it is a relatively new architectural temple, Ngoc Son is a typical example of spatial and architectural design.|||Ngoc Son Island used to be called Tượng Nhĩ (elephant's ears). King Ly Thai To moved the capital to Thang Long and renamed the island Ngoc Tuong. Later, during the Tran dynasty, it was renamed Ngoc Son. A temple was built here to honor heroes who sacrificed during the resistance against the Mongol invaders. It later collapsed. During the Le dynasty (1735-1739), Lord Trinh Giang built Thuy Khanh palace.|||Later, the palace was destroyed. A philanthropist named Tin Trai built a pagoda on the old palace grounds. In 1843, a charity organization rebuilt the main halls and brought in the statue of Van Chang de quan to worship, renaming it Ngoc Son shrine.|||According to ""Ha Thanh linh tich co luc"", from the Le dynasty, there was a temple on Ngoc Son island dedicated to Quan Cong, a famous figure known for his loyalty during the Chinese Tam Quoc period. When the Le king and Trinh lord used the lake for naval drills, the temple was considered a martial temple. People from Ha Noi placed a statue of Tran Hung Dao alongside Quan Cong. However, ""Khâm dinh Viet su thong giam cuong muc"" states it was a statue of Le Lai, a founding hero of the Le dynasty who sacrificed himself to save his king.|||In 1865, the 18th year of Tu Duc's reign, the Confucian scholar Nguyen Van Sieu renovated the temple. The renovated temple was built with additional earth and a stone embankment around it, and a Tran Ba pavilion was constructed. A bridge was built from the east bank to the temple, called The Huc Bridge. On the old Ngoc Boi hill, a stone tower was built, with its top shaped like a brush tip, and its body inscribed with the words ""Ta Thanh Thien"" (Writing to the Blue Sky). It is now commonly called But Tower. Next to it is a coiled gate called Nguen, topped with a stone ink slab in the shape of half a peach cut lengthwise, with three frogs on it. The ink slab is inscribed with a poem about its usefulness from a philosophical perspective. People later praised it as: ""Nhat dai Phuong Dinh but"". From the outer gate, there are two walls on either side, one with a dragon tablet and the other with a tiger tablet, symbolizing the two prestigious lists of names of those who passed the exams, encouraging scholars to work harder.|||The name of The Huc Bridge means keeping the beautiful light of the sun. The Huc Bridge leads to the gate of Ngoc Son Temple. The main temple consists of two connected temples, the first one to the north worships Tran Hung Dao and Van Chang. The statue of Van Chang stands, holding a pen, placed on a stone pedestal about 1m high, with two stone staircases on either side. To the south is Tran Ba pavilion (a pavilion blocking waves - implying a pillar standing firm against unhealthy waves in contemporary culture). The pavilion is square with eight roofs, two-tiered roofs, supported by eight columns, four outer columns made of stone, and four inner columns made of wood. The deities worshiped in the temple, apart from Van Chang De Quan, Lu Dong Tan, Quan Van Truong, Tran Hung Dao, also include Amitabha Buddha. This reflects the Vietnamese concept of Tam giao dong nguyen.|||The combination of Ngoc Son Temple and Hoan Kiem Lake forms an architectural unity of Heaven and Human, creating an ancient, harmonious beauty for the temple and the lake.|||It evokes a sense of harmony between humans and nature.

According to legend, the area was once a flat plain, then suddenly a spring burst forth, flooding a vast area. A god placed a lid over the spring, which became Ba Ra mountain.|||Located in a low hill region with rugged terrain and dense vegetation, in the early 20th century, the Ba Ra mountain area was considered a place of ""wild forest and poisonous water"", inaccessible to people. In 1925, the French colonizers built a penal colony here to detain political prisoners and those suspected of being communists but without a conviction. Later, when the US got involved in Vietnam, they took over this area and built a modern military base, including a helicopter airfield, on the mountaintop to control the entire Southeast region. However, with the strong and unyielding fighting will of the people and soldiers of Binh Phuoc, the French and American forces eventually withdrew from Ba Ra mountain. Today, many historical relics related to the two wars remain, such as: Ba Ra prison (built by the French), helicopter airfield (built by the US), Dove cave, Sung tree cave, Ba Bay Tuyết cave (where the people and soldiers of Binh Phuoc once resided to resist the French and Americans)…|||At the foot of Ba Ra mountain lies Thac Mo lake, covering around 12,000ha with a capacity of 1.3 billion m3 of water. The lake has 10 large and small islands, surrounded by lush greenery.

"51","Bo Da Pagoda","Location: Bo Da Pagoda is located at the northern foot of Phuong Hoang Mountain, in Thuong Lat village, Tien Son commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province. Characteristics: Bo Da Pagoda is one of the centers of Buddhism of the Truc Lam Tam To sect.|||Built in the Ly dynasty - 11th century and rebuilt in the early 18th century, Bo Da Pagoda is a collection of relics including the main pagoda (Tu An Tu) and two temples dedicated to Duc Thanh Hoa and Thach Tuong Dai Vuong.|||The Buddhist scriptures are placed on 8 racks, each rack holding 4 volumes of 240 wooden blocks, totaling nearly 2,000 blocks. Each block, used for carving the scriptures, measures on average 50cm in length, 25cm in width, and 2.5cm in thickness. To display the entire collection of ancient scriptures, a space of 250m² would be needed to lay out the wooden blocks. The scriptures were carved on market wood, a type of wood commonly found in the local forest. Market wood is not only durable but also very light, making it ideal for carving and transporting the scriptures. The scriptures were compiled based on the idea of the sect founders, who also built the pagoda, aiming to create a Buddhist scripture to teach and leave a special Buddhist legacy for posterity. The scriptures reflect the thoughts of two major Buddhist streams in Asia: India and China.|||Bo Da Pagoda is very beautiful and serene, surrounded by earthen walls, and distant mountains and rivers. Many people call it the 'earth pagoda' due to its earthy brown color, from the water basin to the walls and old moss-covered bricks. Visitors can admire the statues of Truc Lam Tam To (Tran Nhan Tong, Phap Loa, and Huyen Quang). Notably, the pagoda preserves the oldest Buddhist scripture in Vietnam, carved on market wood.|||The wooden scripture discusses the characteristics of Chinese Buddhism as it was introduced to Vietnam, with its three main sects (Zen, Pure Land, and Esoteric Buddhism). The focus is on human suffering and liberation, particularly the Four Noble Truths - four wonderful truths of Buddhism: the truth of suffering, the truth of the origin of suffering, the truth of the cessation of suffering, and the truth of the path to the cessation of suffering. After nearly 300 years, the scriptures remain largely intact, with the wooden blocks still durable, beautiful, and unaffected by pests, despite not being treated with any preservatives. The scriptures are carved in Chinese characters with delicate strokes that remain clear and vibrant.|||The uniqueness of this special scripture attracts thousands of visitors each year to explore and pay respects. The scripture also mentions the realm of Nirvana, the cycle of rebirth and death, and explains the concepts of accumulating virtue and the realm of non-action. The scripture reflects the thoughts of Vietnamese Buddhism, particularly the influence of the Truc Lam Tam To Zen sect.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/BacGiang/Chuaboda/03ChuaBoDa11.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/BacGiang/Chuaboda/03ChuaBoDa10.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/BacGiang/Chuaboda/03ChuaBoDa09JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/BacGiang/Chuaboda/03ChuaBoDa08JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/BacGiang/Chuaboda/03ChuaBoDa07JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/BacGiang/Chuaboda/03ChuaBoDa06.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/BacGiang/Chuaboda/03ChuaBoDa05.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/BacGiang/Chuaboda/03ChuaBoDa04.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/BacGiang/Chuaboda/03ChuaBoDa03JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/BacGiang/Chuaboda/03ChuaBoDa02.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/BacGiang/Chuaboda/03ChuaBoDa01JPG.jpg"

Features: Truc Bach Lake, along with West Lake, creates a beautiful landscape for Hanoi capital.|||According to the book 'Tay Ho Chi', Truc Bach Lake was formed in the 17th century when people from Yen Hoa (now Yen Phu) and Yen Quang (now Quan Thanh) villages built a dike to block the southeast corner of West Lake for fish farming. During the reign of Lord Trinh Giang (1729 - 1740), he took a piece of land south of the lake in Truc Yen village to build a palace for relaxation, called Truc Lam Vien. However, a few years later, the palace became a prison for female servants who committed crimes. These women had to weave silk to make a living, and their silk became famous throughout the region, known as 'Truc village silk', or 'Truc Bach'. From then on, the separated part of the lake near Truc Yen village was also called Truc Bach Lake. In the second year of Le Chieu Thong (1788), King Le Chieu Thong ordered the burning of Lord Trinh's palace, and Truc Lam Vien was also destroyed.|||Most tourists visiting Hanoi stop by Truc Bach Lake because there are many historical sites and unique architectural works around it.

In the past, it was covered in lush green bamboo forests, with bamboo swaying gently in the wind. In 1089, General Ly Thuong Kiet's fleet sailed through Quyen Son village on a southern campaign. Suddenly, a strong gust of wind blew, snapping the mast and lifting the army's large flag to the top of the mountain.|||Ly Thuong Kiet then ordered the boats to stop, and together with his soldiers, went ashore to perform a ceremony to pray to heaven and earth for a great victory. After that great victory, Ly Thuong Kiet and his troops came here to hold a thanksgiving ceremony, reward the army and organize a festival for the villagers to celebrate the victory. The festival lasted for a month with all sorts of entertainment.|||The incident of the flag being blown away by the wind led Ly Thuong Kiet to name the mountain Cuon Son. Later, to commemorate the merits of the talented general, the villagers of Cuon Son built a temple dedicated to Ly Thuong Kiet at the very place where he held the festival.|||The temple was built in the middle of a large bamboo forest, so it's called Bamboo Temple. After nearly a thousand years, the bamboo forest is not as pristine as it used to be, but around the temple, there are still countless bamboo trees. The golden-bodied bamboo trees sway gently in the wind, making the scenery here even more poetic. Over time, the temple has only managed to retain some of its basic features.|||The temple is made of lim wood, over 6m high. The front house is a 5-room structure. The chevron system with variations in the form of a rường frame with con nhị appeared at the end of the 17th century and became popular at the end of the 19th century.|||The three rear rooms are built in the same style as the front house, with two butted ends, semi-circular roof tiles, built with thất bricks, and exposed trusses.|||The doors are carved with four precious themes.|||When visiting Truc Temple, don't forget to stop by Cuon Son (now called Cam Mountain) next door. Perhaps because of its association with a legendary auspicious event in the past, the mountain holds spiritual significance for the local people. That's why Cam Mountain still retains much of its pristine beauty with a rich ecosystem. On the peak of Cam Mountain, there is a naturally formed stone chessboard - a place where mythical immortals often gather to play chess, drink wine, and admire the earthly scenery. Right next to the chessboard is a square hole called the 'emperor's tomb'.|||Mount Cam features a unique cave system: 5 connected caves forming a continuous cave system called Ngu Dong Son. The caves' structures are diverse with many types of stalactites and stalagmites of various shapes, evoking rich imagination for tourists: shapes like a mother's milk, a steaming rice pot, an elephant, a turtle... Their colors, porosity, and texture also differ. Some stalactites hidden in darkness sparkle like jewels when lit by torches. Others resemble a lying drum, a hanging drum, or a set of clappers, and remarkably, when struck, they produce a realistic sound.|||The poetic and unique landscape of Cam Mountain has captivated many wandering poets and travelers, inspiring beautiful poems that have been passed down. Today, visiting Truc Temple and Ngũ Động Sơn, tourists will feel as though they've entered a mystical realm, and next year, they'll want to wander back again.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNam/ChuaTrucNguDongSon/Ngudongson04.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNam/ChuaTrucNguDongSon/Ngudongson03.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNam/ChuaTrucNguDongSon/Ngudongson02.jpg"

Features: Ba Den Mountain is the highest peak in Southeast Vietnam with majestic natural scenery, a system of caves, and ancient temples.|||Mount Ba Den is also known as Van Son Mountain due to its year-round cloud cover.|||Mount Ba Den is associated with the legend of a beautiful girl named Ly Thi Thien Huong.|||She was loved by Le Sy Triet, from Quang Hoa (now Trang Bang district, Tay Ninh province), who was talented and ambitious, and had gone to serve Nguyen Hue to protect the country.|||On the occasion of Doan Ngo Festival, she followed a pilgrimage group to Mount Mot to pray for peace in the country and for her lover to return soon. However, she was surrounded and captured by the authorities with intentions to harm her. In her desperation, she jumped off the mountain to maintain her loyalty to her lover. That night, she appeared in a dream to the head monk of the temple on the mountain, asking him to bring her body back for burial. After her death, she became very spiritual and was believed to protect and bless the people, so a shrine was built for her on the mountain. When Nguyen Anh became king, known as Gia Long, he remembered the advice of the Lady that helped him escape and hid on the mountain. He then conferred upon her the title Linh Son Thanh Mau and had a black bronze statue made for worship. Since then, Mount Mot has been called Mount Ba Den.|||The Ba Den mountain complex covers an area of about 24km², consisting of 3 peaks: Heo mountain - Phung mountain - Ba Den mountain.

It was built by district magistrate Bui Cong Dat at the beginning of the 19th century as a place to cultivate his spirit after retirement. When he passed away, monk Hue Dang mobilized his followers to build it into a large temple.|||The temple was constructed in the style of Giac Lam Pagoda in Gia Dinh but on a larger scale with 178 pillars, two courtyards, and five halls. It was completed in 1849 and named Vinh Truong, inspired by a couplet: 'Vinh cuu doi son ha / Truong ton te thien dia'.|||Locals still call it Vinh Trang Pagoda. In 1907, monk Tra Chanh Hau renovated the main hall, blending Asian and European architectural styles. In 1930, monk Minh Dang restored the pagoda extensively to give it its current appearance.|||The temple was built in the form of the Chinese character 'Quoc', similar to Chinese temples, but Vinh Trang Temple features Renaissance-style patterns, Roman-style arches, French-style ironwork, and Japanese-style glazed tile flooring. The Chinese characters are written in ancient seal script, while the Vietnamese text is written in Gothic style. Overall, the temple's exterior architecture is a unique and harmonious blend of Asian and European styles. However, the interior architecture still retains traditional Vietnamese sculptural elements.|||The pagoda consists of four consecutive sections (front hall, main hall, ancestor's house, and rear house), covering an area of 14,000m², 70m long and 20m wide, built with cement and precious wood, on a 1m high foundation, surrounded by solid walls.

The pagoda has a five-roof structure representing the five elements (metal, wood, water, fire, earth) according to Eastern philosophy.|||The surrounding area is filled with beautiful gardens planted with many fragrant flowers and exotic grasses, serene water ponds filled with the sweet scent of lotus, and ancient trees providing a canopy of shade. This creates a perfect harmony between the natural landscape and the architectural space, adding to the temple's ancient and solemn charm.|||Standing out in the garden is a 24m high statue of Amitabha Buddha (6m pedestal, 18m statue). The white statue depicts the Buddha standing watching over the sentient beings of all realms. The statue is believed by locals to be the iconic symbol of the temple today.|||Cultural experts say the beauty of the temple lies in its sculptural art and can be seen as a reflection of the history of fine arts in Tien Giang. Every day, besides devotees coming to worship, many tourists visit Vinh Trang Pagoda; it is most crowded on full moon days, the 1st of the lunar month, and holidays.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/TienGiang/ChuaVinhTrang/ChuaVinhTrang05.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/TienGiang/ChuaVinhTrang/ChuaVinhTrang03.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/TienGiang/ChuaVinhTrang/ChuaVinhTrang04.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/TienGiang/ChuaVinhTrang/ChuaVinhTrang01.jpg"

The flocks of birds fly back to their nests in an orderly manner, separated by their plumage and species. Some formations resemble arrows, while others form hearts or scattered groups. The white color belongs to the Ngao Co flock, and the black color like black oil belongs to the Cong Coc flock. They swarm on the treetops, covering the sky. The forest suddenly becomes lively with various sounds: the wind whistling, wings flapping, leaves rustling, and mother birds calling their young.|||If visitors wish to spend the night at the bird garden, they can enjoy the serenade of nature with the rustling of leaves, the sounds of nocturnal birds foraging, the whispering of the wind at the beginning of the season, and the light rain on the leaves. All these sounds blend together to create the music of the forest, the breath of nature, which sounds gentle and soothing. In the morning, waking up to the birds singing in the early sunshine, visitors will feel their souls become pure and calm.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/05KBTbaclieu03.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/05KBTbaclieu02.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/05KBTbaclieu01.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/chim-bl.jpg"

Teacher Chu Van An and his students often took bamboo tubes and inserted them into the well, then pulled them out to get soft, mud-like vermilion, which they would dry to harden. The teacher used these vermilion sticks to write poems, essays, and grade students' papers. Many people who admired his virtue often came to ask him for a calligraphic character written with vermilion.|||The Chu Van An tomb complex is located in a beautiful spot on the eastern peak of Phoenix Mountain, about 600m from the main temple.

In the 1970s, a 1.2m high blue and white ceramic vase was offered 25 taels of gold, after deducting dozens of taels that had been gilded around the mouth. The story of buying elephant ivory in Saigon in the 1940s and then selling it to Tran Trinh Trach, the salt king of Bac Lieu, for ""any price"" is also remarkable, but the Duong family refused to sell and brought it back to Binh Thuy to enjoy.|||Spanning over a century with many natural storms and 30 years of war, it's miraculous that this house still stands in the ""land of talented people"" of Can Tho: Long Tuyen - Binh Thuy.

"118","Thu Bon River","Location: Thu Bon River originates from numerous small streams flowing down from Ngoc Linh mountain at the border of Quang Nam and Kon Tum provinces (Duy Xuyen district). Characteristics: Thu Bon River is like a vibrant vein of Quang Nam - Da Nang land, winding through rugged mountains in western Quang Nam and then flowing down to fertile plains.|||Over a long journey of hundreds of kilometers, the river thunders through rapids and waterfalls, then stretches leisurely through fertile fields and affluent villages, and passes through thriving industrial areas, each section showcasing its unique character. But no matter where it flows, the Thu Bon River is a harmonious blend of natural beauty and the richness of resources, shaped by the hands and minds of the people of Quang Nam. From Tra Mi, the river flows towards Tien Phuoc.|||Downstream of Tien Phuoc is Thac Ca waterfall, where water cascades down like a white silk ribbon against the green backdrop of the forest. The area is serene and peaceful, only occasionally disrupted by a herd of elephants crossing the river, causing a commotion in the rushing water.|||Beyond Tra Linh, the river winds its way between two towering mountains known as Hon Kem, resembling a wall. At the foot of Hon Kem are many white rocks, which still bear ancient Chieng Thanh inscriptions.|||Upon reaching Giao Thuy, the Thu Bon River merges with the Vu Gia River branch from Ha Tan, and together they flow southward, then splits into two branches encircling the Go Noi area.|||The two streams then flow through Cho Cui and Cau Lau before converging again to exit at Cua Dai.|||The riparian areas in Duy Xuyen and Dien Ban, where the Thu Bon River flows, still hold poetic and touching stories.|||The folk tale of Chiêm Sơn's maiden has been passed down. When still young, Lord Nguyên Phuc Lan lived with his father, Thuy Quan Cong, who was the governor of Quang Nam, at Thanh Chiêm citadel. One moonlit night, Lord Nguyen Phuc Lan and his father released a boat to play on the Thu Bon river. In the quiet night, they suddenly heard a mesmerizing singing voice coming from a mulberry bush. The royal boat hastily docked at the shore. Under the mulberry trees, bathed in the golden moonlight, Nguyen Phuc Lan - later to become the Lord - was captivated by the beauty of a young woman named Doan from Tien Phuoc district, Dien Ban prefecture. He had her brought to the palace, and she, who used to pick mulberries by the Thu Bon river, became Hieu Chieu Hoang Hau, the mother of Thai Ton Nguyen Phuc Tan, also known as Chua Hien.|||Nowadays, in Chiêm Sơn (Duy Xuyen), towards the West of Go Coc Hung, there is still the Vinh Vien tomb, dedicated to Hieu Chieu Hoang Hau. The Thu Bon river also runs deep in the memories and feelings of many Quang Nam writers. In the poem 'Tu vung dat que huong', writer Nguyen Van Bong writes about the Thu Bon river: 'From my village to Hoi An, in the evening I departed from the Thu Bon river pier, then took a boat. At night, the boat departed, leaving the pier, now rowing, now raising the sail to run swiftly on the water. At midnight, waking up, I drifted in the sound of singing.|||The singing echoed behind the boat, and on other boats going downstream, the voices of men and women responded to each other, resonating across the moonlit water... The next morning, I opened my eyes to find the boat had anchored at Hoi An pier. On both sides of the river, this side was the town, that side was Cam Pho, roosters crowed. On the water and on the streets, vendors called out to sell chao hen, khoai Tien Doa, Quang noodles, and banh mi mat nam (braised pork sauce)'. The Thu Bon river has clear green water, vast mulberry fields, and many poetic scenes.|||During the resistance war against France (1946-1954), the Thu Bon River was a borderline: the right bank and west were free zones; the left bank and east were temporarily occupied. Many fierce battles against French colonizers and American invaders took place on both banks and on the river. Countless revolutionary soldiers, militia, guerrilla fighters, and patriotic civilians forever remained on the land attached to this river. Those people became immortal. The Thu Bon River remains beautiful and fresh, like a vibrant vein of Quang Nam - Da Nang land.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/ThuBonRiver3.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/ThuBonRiver2.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/ThuBonRiver.jpg"
"119","Son Doong Cave","Location: Son Trach commune, Bo Trach district, Quang Binh province, in the core zone of Phong Nha - Ke Bang National Park. Characteristics: It is the world's largest natural cave.|||Son Doong is 3 million years old, nearly 9km long, 200m high, and 160m wide - large enough to fit a 40-storey building. With an estimated volume of 38.5 million cubic meters, Son Doong surpasses Deer Cave in Malaysia to become the world's largest natural cave. The 80m-high stalagmite columns inside the cave are also considered the tallest.|||It's known that the world's largest cave was discovered by a local man. Later, the British Royal Cave Exploration Team continued to explore and announce it. Son Doong was formed on a fault line of the Truong Son mountain range and eroded by the Rao Thuong river over millions of years, creating a giant tunnel beneath the limestone mountain. The cracks on the ceiling of the cave were eroded and collapsed, forming large sinkholes that opened up to the outside.|||The drops of water falling from the ceiling over millions of years created cave pearls with sizes as large as baseballs.|||Inside that majestic space is a separate world, a rare natural wonder that amazed Son Doong conquerors.|||Currently, the only way to reach Son Doong is to hike through the forest to Ban Doong – a small village of the Bru-Van Kieu ethnic minority community. From Ban Doong, continue deep into the Phong Nha – Ke Bang National Park forest to Hang En – the third largest cave in the world and also the entrance to Son Doong.|||The highlight inside the cave is a massive natural stalactite and stalagmite formation in Son Doong, from a distance, towards the first Sinkhole area, you can see the silhouette of the Dog's Footprint Rock towering, a majestic scene of the world's largest cave.|||From this position to get to the first Sinkhole, you have to go through a huge cave section over 1km long. From this position, you can almost admire the entire Son Doong cave.|||The second collapse doline of Son Doong, also known as the ""Garden of Eden"", offers a panoramic view of the forest below. The formation of this doline allows sunlight to filter into the cave, creating a small forest with trees and vegetation. A unique ecosystem within Son Doong cave has developed thanks to the sunlight.|||Inside the cave there are two campsites: the first campsite of Son Doong Cave is located near the First Sinkhole. The campsite is on a fairly flat sandy area with a stunning view of the First Sinkhole. The second campsite is also known as the beachside campsite because it is on a cave floor covered in white sand like a beach. This is also considered the most majestic campsite in the world.|||The end of the cave is a 90m-high stalactite wall named “The Vietnam Wall”. This is also the highest ceiling of the cave, about 200m. This section of the cave is quite muddy.|||When reaching the top of The Vietnam Wall is the exit of the cave.|||Currently, only Oxalis Adventure Company is licensed to operate adventure tours to explore Son Doong. These expeditions require tourists to be in good health, without heart disease, high blood pressure, or other health issues, and to provide detailed health information when registering. The tour typically lasts 4 days, with a high price tag, limited to 10 guests per tour, and usually operates from January to August.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/SonDong.jpg"
"120","Sin Ho","Location: About 40km from Lai Chau town on road 4D. Characteristics: This village is home to many different ethnic groups and has a vibrant weekly market on Sundays.|||Sin Ho is a highland district in Lai Chau province, with its district capital being Sin Ho town. Sin Ho district has 56,000 residents consisting of 15 ethnic groups living together on an area of 1,746km². Geographically, the north of Sin Ho borders Yunnan (China), the east borders Phong Tho district, the south borders Tua Chua district (Dien Bien) and the west borders Muong Te district.|||In the local language, ""Sin Ho"" is where many streams converge. At an altitude of 1,500m above sea level, Sin Ho plateau is likened to the roof of Lai Chau province. The climate here is quite similar to that of Sa Pa town, cool all year round, creating conditions for many temperate flowers and fruits such as plums, peaches, pears... to develop.|||Sin Ho, an attractive destination|||From Lai Chau town, the road to Sin Ho passes through many dense forests with valleys, streams and a quite rich system of caves. From Dien Bien, you can get to Sin Ho by National Road 12 to Muong Lay, then at Cha Nua junction, turn into Provincial Road 128 to have the chance to travel along the majestic Da River, conquer two passes Ma Thi Ho (Muong Lay) and Cha Nua (Sin Ho) covered in clouds all year round.|||Regardless of the route taken, visitors can enjoy the pristine beauty and the adventurous feeling when winding along the ups and downs, sharp turns that make you dizzy…|||Sin Ho boasts many attractive scenic spots such as Cong Troi, Tien Ong mountain, O Da mountain... associated with numerous legendary tales. Visitors will be amazed and delighted by the sight of misty mountains and valleys turning golden during harvest season.|||Exploring the villages of Pu Dao, Ta Ghenh, Hoang Ho, Ta Phin, and Phang Xo Lin of the Mong and Dao people, who live close to the mountainside, one might feel as if stepping into a fairy tale. The small wooden houses nestled among the green forests, women from ethnic minorities carrying water up steep slopes, and small pigs foraging at the forest edge create a picturesque scene.|||Sin Ho is even more beautiful on weekends when the market takes place. Although it starts on Saturday morning, it mainly attracts locals living around the town at this time. It becomes truly lively and bustling on Sunday when people from distant villages and communes come, including the Red Mong from Chan Lua, Lang Mo, or the Lu, Yao from Phang Xo Lin, and the Hoa Mong, Phu La from Pu Sam Cap, who travel a whole day to get here. They come with goods they make themselves. The gentle and simple faces, the colorful ethnic costumes, the chatter of buying and selling, and the joyful laughter along with the food brought with the flavor of the mountains and forests create a vibrant picture full of the sounds of life…|||New tourism product|||In recent years, in zone 2 of Sin Ho town, a health care service for tourists has been offered, including herbal baths, massages, and acupressure, provided by Mr. Sung A Pao, a renowned Mong ethnic medicine man. Many leaders of the district and agencies have brought guests to this service, introducing it as a local ""specialty"", but it has yet to develop due to lack of capital and a rational investment strategy.|||The bathing soak solution is a type of black viscous water made from 10 types of medicinal herbs picked from the mountain, including ginger and lemongrass that can be grown in your own garden. Guests will be invited into a small room, to shed their clothes and sit soaking up to their necks in the hot medicinal water solution at around 40º, contained in a wooden barrel, with a strong, pungent aroma.|||It's a medicinal bath, so after just a few minutes of soaking, visitors feel like their body is melting into a pleasant, floating sensation. No wonder before getting into the medicinal tub, the technician keeps reminding: ""if you feel too dizzy, please sit up and pull back the curtain to breathe some fresh air"" (!). After 30 to 40 minutes of soaking, guests are invited upstairs to move on to the ""technical"" stage of massage and acupressure.|||Many people, after lying on their stomach to experience the renowned doctor's fingers tracing across various acupressure points on their body, can't help but acknowledge that Mr. Pao possesses a pair of ""golden hands"". Starting from the temples, under the jawline, down the spine, and all the way to the tips of the toes and fingers, wherever Mr. Pao's hands touch, the initial sensation is a sharp pain, followed by numbness that spreads evenly, leaving the person feeling as though their body is dissolving and then being rearranged, as if preparing for rebirth. The most fascinating part is the ""high-level"" thrust into the back, which seems to transfer an extraordinary force, causing the client to suddenly jump up with a surprising and artistic movement, marking the end of this unique physical therapy session. Notably, the service comes with an equally unique price tag: only 50,000 dong. Before parting ways, clients are also offered a cup of hot medicinal water, brewed from the same herbs used in the therapeutic bath.|||Potential and prospects|||Sin Ho is a potential tourist destination in Lai Chau province, a relatively new spot for many travelers.|||This place boasts stunning natural scenery with famous landmarks like O Rock and Tiên Cave, as well as two historical sites in Le Loi commune: the Le Loi stele carved on the stone wall on the north bank of the Da River and the mansion of the puppet king Deo Van Long during the resistance war against France.|||The area also features unique terraced fields, highland markets with distinct local traditions, and villages of the Mong and Dao ethnic groups nestled on mountain slopes, including Pu Dao village.|||Although Sin Ho attracts around 30,000 domestic and international visitors each year, tourism activities are still spontaneous and lack clear products and target services. In Lai Chau province's socio-economic development plan, the 2011-2015 tourism development project focuses on sustainable tourism development in Sin Ho plateau in stages, including community-based tourism and eco-tourism with homestays. This approach connects cultural villages and existing tourism routes in the Northwest region, while highlighting the folk cultural values of local communities.|||Besides its eco-tourism and resort potential, visitors to Sin Ho can also participate in a health treatment using physical therapy with precious medicinal plants found only in this region. They can enjoy local specialties like beef wrapped in lard leaves, steamed deer, hill pork, brook trout, sticky rice, and thang co ... along with the cold-water salmon, a specialty of the region, successfully farmed locally.|||Hopefully in the near future, Sin Ho tourism will not only stop at its hidden beauty but will be developed reasonably, bringing many interesting inspirations for visitors whenever they have the opportunity to explore. Sin Ho plateau will forever be an impressive destination, both simple and peaceful...","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/LaiChau/CNSinHo/DSC1055JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/LaiChau/CNSinHo/DSC1054JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/LaiChau/CNSinHo/DSC1053-Phong-canh-Sin-Ho.jpg"

In 208, after capturing the magical crossbow, Trieu Da launched a surprise attack on Au Lac, and Thuc An Duong Vuong retreated south. When he reached Cua Hien Beach (at the northern foot of Mo Da Mountain), he was welcomed by Than Kim Quy and Thuy Than.|||To commemorate Thuc An Duong Vuong, after his death, locals built a temple in his honor at Cua Hien. However, whenever night fell, a flickering flame would appear on the slope of Mo Da Mountain, and locals believed it was the king's spirit. They then built a temple at this location, calling it Den Cuong.|||The temple is called Den Cuong, but it implies 'Den Cong,' as 'Cong' in Nghe An dialect means 'Cuong.' Legend says that the Mo Da Mountain area was once inhabited by many peacocks, and the mountain's shape resembles a giant peacock dancing, with the temple located at the bird's head. To this day, there is no historical record of the exact time when Den Cuong Temple was first built. However, during the Nguyen Dynasty, the temple was renovated several times, especially in 1864 when King Tu Duc ordered its reconstruction on a larger scale.|||Den Cuong Temple is a beautiful and sturdy architectural work, harmonizing with the natural surroundings in Central Vietnam, with many green trees planted around it. The temple follows the 'Tam' architecture, comprising three main buildings: Tam Quan, and the Upper, Middle, and Lower Halls.|||The Tam Quan gate is impressive, with three entrances: the central gate has three tiers, and the two side gates have two tiers, all designed in a vaulted style.|||The Upper Hall, where Thuc An Duong Vuong's altar is located, and the Lower Hall, both have a 4-roof architecture with curved eaves. The Middle Hall, dedicated to Cao Lo - the general who helped the king create the magical crossbow, is built with an 8-roof architecture. All structures are grand, with large pillars and thick walls, yet elegant and refined due to intricate carvings and patterns.|||Den Cuong Temple also preserves many valuable artifacts: drums, gongs, statues, and ritual objects. The temple still keeps many documents in Chinese characters on horizontal boards, pillars, and steles, reminding descendants and people of Thuc An Duong Vuong's merits.|||The Den Cuong Temple festival takes place from the 14th to 16th day of the 2nd lunar month every year, attracting locals and tourists to come and pay respects to Thuc An Duong Vuong.

"127","Tu Duc Tomb (Khiem Tomb)","Location: Tu Duc Tomb is located in Thuy Bieu commune, Hue city, Thua Thien - Hue province. Characteristics: The tomb was built in 1864 and completed in 1867 on an area of 475ha. Unlike other tombs which are built symmetrically, Tu Duc Tomb is built in a free and natural style, harmonizing with the available nature, reflecting the romantic spirit of this poet king.|||Tu Duc Tomb is a masterpiece poem, a picturesque landscape painting, evoking for visitors a 'soul of serene poetry' (a sweet dream). The tomb of King Tu Duc was built in an extremely difficult historical context of the country and of the king himself.|||The king was born in 1829 and ascended to the throne at the age of 20 (1848). Ten years later, due to the Hue court applying a narrow-minded foreign policy, French colonizers attacked Da Nang (1858) and then invaded and occupied Gia Dinh (1859) and several other provinces in Southern Vietnam (1862)... King Tu Duc had quite thoroughly absorbed Eastern philosophy and culture, but with an internal contradiction between the positive aspects of his youth and the negative aspects of his old age, between life and death. As he grew older and faced more failures in national affairs, he became increasingly pessimistic. The king thought about the inevitable death that would come to his life, and to alleviate the pain and suffering in his remaining years, he ordered the construction of a tomb like a second imperial palace where he could occasionally come to relax and rest, and also to make it his ""eternal palace"" (vi ngo vinh vu, cited in Khiem Cung Ky).|||Standing in the present day, looking back at the difficult circumstances of the country at that time, the grand and costly architecture of the royal tomb, and the names Khiem Cung and Khiem Lang used to name it, we see that it is also an internal contradiction that is hard to justify by the king himself.|||However, after the construction of the tomb was completed, King Tu Duc lived for another 16 years, until 1883, at the age of 55.|||After officials specializing in geography surveyed the land and chose a site in Duong Xuan Thuong village, King Tu Duc 'finalized' the architectural plan for the tomb according to his own preferences in October 1864. However, they had to choose a good day to start, so construction began in December of that year.||||||The entire construction work of this tomb complex was expected to take 6 years with 3,000 soldiers and workers, and they would be rotated to rest every 3 months. However, the Minister of Public Works, Nguyen Van Chat, petitioned to complete it in just 3 years. The court sent him and Major General Le Van Xa from the Ministry of Defense to oversee the construction.|||Unable to take turns to rest, and forced to work at maximum capacity in poor conditions, these 3,000 disgruntled soldiers and workers heeded the call to rise up by Doan Trung. On the night of 16 to 17 September 1866, they used the banner of ""Nguy Dai Hoan Ton"" to march towards the Imperial City, aiming to overthrow King Tu Duc and install Ung Dao, a 5th generation grandson of King Gia Long, to the throne. However, when they reached the Thai Hoa Hall, they were strongly opposed by the imperial forces and failed. The rebellion was completely crushed. This close call for King Tu Duc was over, but his prestige was considerably damaged, as this was not a foreign invasion but an internal rebellion right at the heart of the central imperial court.|||Among the 13 Nguyen kings, King Tu Duc was the most knowledgeable about Eastern studies, particularly Confucianism. He excelled in history, philosophy, literature, art, and especially poetry. He left behind 600 articles and 4,000 poems and essays in Chinese and around 100 poems in Nom script. His poetry and writings reflect a kind-hearted person, a sensitive soul, and a passion for art.|||This artistic inclination is also evident in the architecture of his tomb. According to historical records, the king himself decided on the construction plan. Within the La Thanh wall, covering approximately 12 hectares, nearly 50 architectural works are scattered across complex terrain with varying heights of around 10 meters.|||However, the stone-paved steps and winding paths made of Bat Trang tiles connect all the architectural works into a unified, harmonious, and intimate whole.|||Beyond Khiem Cung Mon, a two-story triple gate built on high ground, visitors enter a complex of palaces and dozens of large and small buildings, along with ancillary architectural works.||||||The transverse and longitudinal buildings here were reserved for the king and his entourage of ladies-in-waiting to occasionally stay and play. Minh Kiem Hall - an ancient theater with architectural and decorative artistic value. Hoa Kiem Temple - where the king and queen are worshiped, currently contains many royal artifacts and contemporary artworks.|||While the houses in Khiem Cung are made of wood, all the architectural works in the tomb area are built with bricks and stones. The most notable is the largest stele in Vietnam, standing at about 5m high, protected by a large sturdy building with thick columns and walls and a vaulted door. The architects built the Stele Pavilion with such materials and style to withstand the test of time.|||On the hill overlooking the semicircular lake, Tieu Khiem Tri, is Bao Thanh, built of bricks, and in the center is a small stone house, where the king rests. Bao Thanh is covered by a lush green pine forest, which rustles throughout the four seasons.|||In addition, the drainage system throughout the tomb complex has been designed and built to a high standard, with very good circulation. Overall, each architectural work in Tu Duc Tomb has its own unique artistic style, with no repetition and great vitality. The layout of the areas and the arrangement of the architectural works in each area in Tu Duc Tomb have broken the traditional convention of maintaining classical symmetry found in some other tombs. There are winding paths that follow the natural terrain or have been shaped by human hands. The architectural lines are truly free and harmonious with nature, either taking advantage of the existing natural beauty or reworking it to fit the landscape architecture.|||Breaking symmetry is also a beauty in art, and Tu Duc Tomb has that extra beauty. The architecture and nature here evoke new and unique aesthetic emotions for visitors, reflecting the romantic and poetic soul of a poet king.|||Tu Duc Tomb is a masterpiece, a picturesque landscape painting that evokes a serene and dreamy atmosphere for visitors.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/TombofTuDuc-6JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/TombofTuDuc-4.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/TombofTuDuc-1.jpg"

"129","Cam Luong Fish Cave","Location: Cam Luong Fish Cave is located in Cam Luong commune, Cam Thuy district, Thanh Hoa province, about 80km from Thanh Hoa city. Feature: There are thousands of fish swimming in the stream. Locals consider this a sacred school of fish, they never catch them and voluntarily protect them, hoping the gods will bring good weather.|||Traveling nearly 80km from Thanh Hoa city to Cam Thuy district, a boat will take you to the left bank of the Ma River to visit Cam Luong Fish Cave (also known as the ""divine"" Fish Stream), one of the unique natural wonders of Xuc Thanh land.|||Hang Ca is a vast body of water located within the Truong Sinh mountain range.|||The school of ""divine"" fish, with thousands of individuals, swim and play in the stream flowing towards the shore, as if welcoming visitors to the site.|||The ""divine"" fish are stunning to behold, with shiny skin in shades of gold and black, resembling a luxurious brocade; their fins and lips are a vibrant pink, and each fish weighs around 20kg.|||The larger ""divine"" fish only emerge from the cave on high tide days.|||The fish reproduce inside the cave, and the young ones, once they reach about 2kg, swim out of the cave and into the Ngoc stream.|||The school of fish usually stays within the Ngoc stream and rarely swims beyond the confluence of the streams, where the Tu Phu Long Vuong temple is located.|||From the upstream, following the path to Truong Sinh mountain range shrouded in dense Đăng trees, visitors will reach the entrance of Đăng cave at a height of 70m above the ground. Entering the cave, multi-colored stalactites and stalagmites sparkle like diamonds on the cave walls and ceiling, creating a breathtakingly beautiful scene. Đăng cave is high, airy and cool, giving the feeling of standing under a starry summer sky. The cave's interior seems endless, stretching deep into the earth. The gentle gurgling of a small stream nestled beside the cave wall catches the visitor's attention. This is the source of the Cam Luong fish stream.|||Visiting the fish cave, tourists often wonder why it's called the ""divine fish""? The legend of the Muong people tells the story of an old couple who were childless and would often go to their field by the stream to farm and catch fish for food. One day, the old woman found a strange egg while fishing. She threw it back into the water but kept finding it again. She took it home and they decided to let a chicken incubate it. A few days later, the egg hatched into a snake. The old man released the snake into the Ngoc stream, but it kept coming back home. Over time, the snake became like a domesticated animal. Since the snake appeared, the crops flourished, and the region enjoyed peace, prosperity, and happiness. The snake was revered by the villagers and called Chang Ran.|||One stormy night, the snake died under the Truong Sinh mountain, near the Ngoc stream. The villagers were informed by the spirits that Chang Ran had died fighting the water monster that was destroying their village, and he was then crowned by Ngoc Hoang as a god and the Tu Phu Long Vuong. The villagers built the Ngoc temple by the stream to commemorate his merits.|||From then on, the Ngoc stream in front of the temple had a group of thousands of ""divine"" fish that came to pay homage to the gods and guard the Ngoc temple every day and night.|||Every year, on the day of the Tet le Tu phu Long vuong ceremony, the elderly man performed a ritual to ask the gods and waited until the evening, when the fish entered the cave, and any fish that remained in the stream would self-offer as a sacrificial offering.|||The village elder would then take the fish to the temple to offer to the gods and invite the villagers to share in the offering.|||The village custom has been maintained to this day, and as a result, the group of fish in the Ngoc stream has never dwindled, and has instead grown larger and more abundant each day.|||Protecting the ""divine"" fish is a voluntary effort in the minds of the people of Muong village, who wish for the gods to grant them favorable weather and bountiful harvests.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/Cacamluong13.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/Cacamluong08JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/Cacamluong04JPG.jpg"

When King Ly Thai To moved the capital from Hoa Lu to Thang Long, five families with renowned pottery skills from Bo Bat village, Yen Mo district, Truong Yen prefecture (now Yen Mo district, Ninh Binh province) namely Tran, Vuong, Nguyen, Le, and Pham, decided to relocate their skilled craftsmen and families to Thang Long. They eventually settled in Bach Tho quarter, Gia Lam district, Thuan An prefecture (now Bat Trang commune, Gia Lam district, Hanoi), where they found a good source of material for pottery - white clay. Here, they teamed up with the local Nguyen family to open kilns and establish the Bat Trang pottery village.|||Bat Trang ceramics are mostly handmade, showcasing the skill and creativity of the artisans. The creamy white glaze, along with the style of drawing patterns that emphasize description, has been highly regarded by customers for its artistic value. Therefore, ancient Bat Trang ceramic products have very high economic value and are preserved in several domestic and international museums.|||To create ceramic products, artisans first soak clay in a system of 4 tanks at different heights for about 3-4 months to remove impurities. Then, they use the clay to shape the product, let it sit, and refine its shape. Next, the product is dried and baked in a drying kiln to prevent warping, cracking, or breaking, and then decorated with patterns. The craftsman uses a brush to directly draw harmonious patterns on the product. Once complete, the product is cleaned with a feather duster and fired at low temperature, then glazed. The glazing technique involves various methods such as spraying, pouring, dipping, and others. The final step, firing the ceramic in a kiln, requires gradually increasing the temperature until the ceramic is done, then gradually decreasing it. After firing, the kiln doors are sealed for slow cooling over 2 days and nights. The doors are then opened and the ceramics left for another day and night before being removed.|||Bat Trang ceramic products come in various designs, patterns, and types, categorized into groups based on their functional use: household ceramics, worship items, art ceramics, construction ceramics, and decorative ceramics. With their passion for their craft and diligent labor, research, and creativity, Bat Trang artisans have created a vibrant, diverse, and dynamic world of ceramics. Bat Trang ceramics are famous not only domestically but also exported to many countries worldwide, such as the European Union, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, the United States, etc.|||In October 2004, Bat Trang Ceramic Market was opened on a campus of over 5,000m², featuring stalls of nearly 1,000 households specializing in ceramic and porcelain products.|||This market is not only a place for trading and display but also a popular tourist spot in Hanoi, attracting many domestic and international visitors.|||Bat Trang also preserves many historical and cultural relics such as communal houses, temples, and pagodas.|||These architectural works, along with ceramic products and the friendly, hospitable locals, have left unforgettable impressions on visitors.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/DIEMDULICHBOSUNG2020/HaNoi/LanggomBatTrang/Battrang1JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/Battrang12JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/Battrang06JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/Battrang02JPG.jpg"

They are called Thap Doi because the two towers stand almost parallel to each other.|||Both towers are not traditional square multi-story Cham towers but are composed of two main parts: a square body and a curved roof.|||At first glance, this tower looks like a 12th-century Khmer temple.|||This assessment is based on the Garuda deity images arranged at the four corners of the eaves with two raised hands and lowered feet as if supporting the roof.|||The roof is not a system of gradually shrinking floors like traditional Cham towers but a single block with four faces, each divided into six floors with horizontal eaves, and each floor divided into five compartments, with the central one being the largest featuring a person sitting in meditation with crossed legs.|||The four corners of the roof are decorated with five-headed Naga snakes.|||Meanwhile, the entire body of the tower retains its original shape, structure, and characteristic decoration of traditional Champa ancient towers: a square body, each exterior wall with a fake door with a vaulted arch rising like spears, smooth pilasters running along the body, between the pilasters are solid, raised masses, no longer with decorative motifs on the exterior surface of the tower wall... The base of the tower is surrounded by a belt of large stone blocks supporting the entire tower, interspersed with images of elephants, lions, and dancing figures.|||Of the two towers, the North Tower is taller and less deteriorated than the South Tower.

At the junction of the roof and the tower body, a meditating monk is depicted, flanked by symmetrical elephant pairs.|||The South Tower has a similar structure to the North Tower, but at the eaves, instead of female figures, the decorative carvings depict a herd of 13 deer with different postures, looking playful and lively.|||In 2008, the Twin Towers historical site was restored by the government to its original appearance and has become one of the most attractive destinations when tourists visit Quy Nhon city.|||Come here to admire the artistic architectural works built by talented artisans from many centuries ago.|||Visitors seem to immerse themselves in a mysterious world to reminisce about a civilization of the Champa kingdom.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/08Thapdoi03.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/08Thapdoi02.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/08Thapdoi01.jpg"

Next to them are granite clusters covered in lichen and moss, seemingly sleeping here for a thousand years.|||Notably, from any position, visitors can hear the constant roar of the stream flowing from the mountain peak, creating deep pools with clear water that allows one to see white pebbles at the bottom. Water cascades down, creating white foam, and the misty air carries tiny droplets, creating a refreshing atmosphere.

Characteristics: This is one of the hot mineral water sources in Vietnam used for therapeutic purposes.|||From Ngo May town, Phu Cat district, heading northwest less than 10km, visitors will arrive at Hoi Van hot spring.|||The stream is called Hoi Van because the water vapor rising from it condenses into clouds above the trees. People walking below, beside the stream, seem to be walking on clouds, hence the name Hoi Van, meaning ""cloud gathering"".|||Hoai Van Hot Spring is also known as Tien Spring, originating from a legend. A beautiful Champa princess suffered from a strange disease that no doctor could cure. Her skin broke out in ugly bumps, causing her to feel ashamed and hide in the palace. The king took her on a hunting trip and discovered a forest stream with clear water bubbling up from underground. He had a screen set up for the princess to bathe, and miraculously, she felt relief from her itching and discomfort. She asked to stay by the spring and bathe daily, and over time, her condition improved, and her skin regained its beauty. People believed that the spring was blessed by the gods, and that's why it's also called Tien Spring.|||The stream originates from the low mountains in the north of Phu Cat district, flowing into a large pond in Hoi Van village. The pond covers about 400m² and is over 1m deep. The bottom of the pond is lined with jagged rocks.|||Hot water springs up from the pond, releasing steam that rises like smoke. The pond is situated in a vast sand valley surrounded by mountains. To the northeast lies the majestic Ba mountain range. On cold days, especially early in the morning, the rising water vapor creates a misty atmosphere, making the scene mystical. When the sun shines, the fog clears, revealing a clear body of water where you can see the hot springs bubbling up from the bottom, resembling dragons playing in the water.|||The sandy shores around the pond are white and fine, making it an ideal spot to bask in the sun.|||The natural mineral water source in Hoi Van is very abundant and rich in therapeutic potential for various types of diseases. Today, through research, it has been discovered that the hot water contains sulfur and various minerals that are suitable for treating skin diseases, arthritis, and cardiovascular conditions.|||The water here has a temperature of over 80°C and is dissolved with over 20 minerals, including chloride, hydrocarbonate, and sulfate sodium, making it a type of hot Silica mineral water used in some renowned spas worldwide.|||In early 1976, the Hoi Van hot mineral water spa was established, welcoming many patients for treatment. Various therapies were applied, including mineral water, mud baths, and physical therapy such as individual pool baths, pressure shower baths, and combined therapies like psychology, physiotherapy, massage, and acupuncture.|||By June 2004, the Hoi Van spa was upgraded to the Binh Dinh Rehabilitation and Nursing Hospital.

In 1616, she and her teacher took the examination together, with her teacher ranking second and she topping the list.|||After passing the exam, she was invited to the palace to attend a banquet for new scholars. During the banquet, the king discovered that she was a girl disguised as a boy. However, impressed by her talent and virtue, the king invited her to the Ly Cung Dong Lan palace to teach the princes and princesses. He also proposed to her, and they got married, with her being titled Tinh Phi (Star Sa).|||In 1625, King Mac Kinh Cung was captured by Trinh Kien of the Le dynasty and brought back to Thang Long to face trial. Afterwards, Madame Duet escaped to Ha Lang and then took refuge in Sung Phuc Pagoda, where she was ordained with the dharma name Dieu Huyen, the nickname Du, and the name Ban Huyen Du was also given according to her name. While at the pagoda, she often taught morality and lectured on Buddhist scriptures to the local people.|||In 1631, knowing she was in Ha Lang, Trinh Trang, the Lord of Trinh, welcomed her back to Thang Long and appointed her as Le Thi. At the end of her life, despite King Le and Lord Trinh Tac wanting to keep her in the capital, she firmly refused, wishing to return to her homeland. After her death, her tomb was buried in her hometown of Hai Duong. Later, to commemorate Madame Duet, the people of Ha Lang (Cao Bang) cast her statue for worship in the pagoda.|||During the reign of King Le Hien Tong, the royal court issued an imperial decree for this complex of temples and pagodas.

While working as an internal supervisor in the court, he learned the art of water puppetry from troupes performing for the king and royal court. After returning to his village, he established a small water puppet troupe and taught this art form to the villagers. Every year, on the 24th day of the 2nd lunar month (the day of his death), the villagers hold a ceremony to offer incense and perform water puppet shows to commemorate his merits.|||In Dao Thuc water puppet village, puppets are created by the villagers based on characters from Vietnamese folk tales. Each puppet is about 30-40cm tall, made of wood, and coated with paint to prevent water damage. Unlike other puppet troupes, Dao Thuc puppets can move left, right, and even turn around to enter the performance area. The puppeteers use a special device to control the puppets, allowing them to move their arms and hands. The puppets' movements are synchronized with music, singing, and drums. Over 20 plays are performed, including ancient stories, agricultural activities, folk games, and national legends. In recent years, new performances have been created to praise the homeland and country, such as 'Tặng hoa ngày hội', 'Rước ảnh Bác Hồ', and 'Hà Nội 12 ngày đêm'.|||The Dao Thuc puppet troupe has over 30 artists, mostly farmers who perform during their free time.

Characteristics: The tower is a place of worship for the ancient Cham people.|||Nhan Tower was built at the end of the 11th century or beginning of the 12th century on a relatively flat land near the top of Nhan Mountain.|||There is a legend about the construction of the tower on Nhan Mountain. During that time, Luong Phu Gia's army (also known as Luong Van Chanh) clashed with the Cham army (also known as Chiem Thanh). The battlefield took place on the land of Tuy Hoa city today. Luong Phu Gia's army was stationed at Nhuu Mountain, while the Cham army was stationed at Nhan Mountain to defend. The battle was extremely fierce with no clear winner.|||To avoid harm to people and property of the civilians, the two sides agreed to build a tower. The side that completed the tower first would win, and the losing side would have to withdraw their troops from Phu Yen. The two locations chosen by the two sides were: the Cham army on Nhan Mountain and Luong Phu Gia's army on Co Rua Mountain, an outcrop of Nhuu Mountain.|||The Cham army devoted all their strength day and night to building, but just as they were about to complete it, Phu Gia's tower was finished, standing tall in the sky. The Cham army had to accept defeat.|||Later, Phu Gia's army challenged the Chiem Thanh to burn the tower; the side whose tower burned first would lose and have to withdraw their troops. Phu Gia's tower burned down in just one night, while the tower on Nhan mountain still stood firm.|||Luong Van Chanh led a large army to the foot of Nhan mountain, forcing the Cham army to retreat to the other side of Ca pass.|||During the resistance war against France (1945 – 1954), when French colonizers invaded our country, they bombarded the tower, causing the top and 3 corners of the tower to collapse. Due to severe damage from the war, at the end of 1960, under the puppet government, Phu Yen province decided to restore the tower, repairing cracks inside and outside.|||The building materials of the tower are all made of burnt bricks with various sizes depending on the position of each wall section and each tower floor, and are arranged tightly together, with no visible mortar but very solidly bonded. The upper rows of bricks are slightly recessed compared to the lower rows until the vault is closed.|||Nhan Tower has a similar architectural style to the Cham Po Nagar tower in Nha Trang, built in a high-rise form. The tower is quadrilateral with 4 floors, getting smaller as it rises, but still following the style of the lower floors. The tower is nearly 23.5m high, with each side of the base being 10m long.|||The roof of the tower consists of multiple stacked layers, the apex is made of a single piece of stone carved into a lotus bud shape. This is a Linga symbol of the Cham people. On the top of the tower, there are four fake windows on each side, separating the upper and lower parts. The main entrance is oriented to the east, with a semicircular arch above it, built in a stepped style. The door frame and lintel are made of soft limestone, easily carved and sculpted.|||Inside the tower, the wall is built straight up from the base to the top. The higher it goes, the smaller the wall becomes, forming a cone shape. The tower wall has no decorative patterns, only a few dragon motifs carved in granite are placed outside the tower corner. Inside the tower, there is no altar, no statue, just a small shrine in front to worship Lady Thuong Dinh Chua Thiet A Na Dien Ngoc Phi built during the Later Le dynasty.|||Notably, at the foot of Nhan Mountain to the southwest, along the Chua River bank, there is a stone standing 1.3m tall and 0.9m wide on each side. The base of the stone features a carved lotus petal design, and on it are inscribed three ancient letters in Sanskrit, commonly found on the pillar plaques of Cham towers. The inscription appears at about one-third of the stone's height.

"217","Long Bien Bridge","Location: Long Bien Bridge spans the Red River, connecting Hoan Kiem and Long Bien districts of Hanoi. Characteristics: Long Bien was the first steel bridge across the Red River and is considered a historical witness to the ups and downs of Hanoi through two wars against France and the US.|||The project was approved by French Governor-General Paul Doumer in 1897 to improve infrastructure for colonial exploitation. The French company Daydé & Pille won the bid to design and build the bridge in 1898. Construction started in 1899 and finished in 1902, initially named Doumer Bridge. It was the largest bridge in Indochina at that time and praised by the French as a bridge connecting two centuries. The bridge has a 2,290m long section across the river with 19 steel beam spans on 20 pillars over 40m high and 896m of access roads built of stone. The design includes a railway track in the middle and roads for pedestrians and carts on both sides. The pedestrian paths were the best places to enjoy the Red River scenery in Hanoi.|||After the liberation of Hanoi (October 10, 1954), the bridge was renamed Long Bien. During the Vietnam War (1954-1975), Vietnamese forces built anti-aircraft artillery positions on the river island and used the bridge's high points as gun emplacements. Damaged bridge spans were replaced with temporary beams to keep traffic flowing. In 2002, the bridge underwent repairs and reinforcement.|||Today, the bridge is only used for trains, motorbikes, bicycles, and pedestrians. A peculiarity of Long Bien Bridge is that traffic flows on the left side, contrary to Vietnam's traffic rules. At the bridge's entrance, a metal plate still shows the construction time and the contractor's name.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/Caulongbien/Caulongbien08.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/Caulongbien/Caulongbien06.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/Caulongbien/Caulongbien05.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/Caulongbien/Caulongbien02.jpg"

The battle marked the development of the Viet Minh army and laid the foundation for future tactics.|||Located on a hill in Dong Khe town, Thạch An district, Cao Bang province, the Dong Khe fort was the site of the opening battle of the 1950 Thu-Dong border campaign, which set the stage for the nation's great resistance war. The Dong Khe relic site includes bunkers, underground tunnels, and other structures like fences, fortifications, and a fortified gate with a 12-firepower gun emplacement.|||Dong Khe was a key point on the French National Route 4 defense line. The enemy forces consisted of two legionnaire companies and a puppet army platoon, equipped with 105mm and 57mm artillery, mortars, and strong firepower. From September 16, 1950, General Hoàng Văn Thái directly commanded the Dong Khe battle to eliminate the enemy stronghold, isolate the enemy in Cao Bang, and create conditions to attack enemy reinforcements on National Route 4. The battle was fought in two phases.|||Phase 1, from 6am on September 16 to dawn on September 17, 1950, focused on destroying outlying positions; our forces captured five outpost forts but did not advance further. The enemy concentrated firepower and launched counterattacks, recapturing three forts and causing us significant difficulties. In phase 2, on September 17, 1950, at 5pm, the commander shifted the 174th Regiment's attack from the north to the northeast to pin down the enemy and create conditions to destroy the central stronghold.|||At 3am on September 18, our artillery fired on enemy targets in the center. Our troops stormed the enemy positions on all fronts, with notable bravery shown by Lý Văn Mưu, La Văn Cầu, and Trần Cừ. Under our intense attack, the enemy retreated to their headquarters.

"221","Chu Van An Temple","Location: It is located in the Phuong Hoang relic site, in Van An ward, Chi Linh town, Hai Duong province, about 80 km east of Hanoi. Characteristics: The temple bears a distinct architectural style from the Nguyen dynasty, and is dedicated to teacher Chu Van An (1292 - 1370).|||The land of Chi Linh was considered by ancient people to be a particularly important strategic location, with the terrain 'Lục thuỷ tứ linh', where six rivers converge into one called Luc Dau Giang. Four majestic mountain ranges form a masterpiece called Tu Linh: Long - Ly - Quy - Phuong. This place is also home to the Phuong Hoang mountain range with 72 peaks, symbolizing 72 phoenix birds spreading their wings. The phoenix is a symbol of wisdom and talent, also known as 'Tieu an co bich' (ancient house wall), the secluded residence of teacher Chu Van An, as recorded in Nguyen Dinh Phu's book 'Phuong Son tu chi luoc' that 'Chu Van Trinh tiên sinh ẩn cư sứ'.|||Chu Van An originally came from Van Thon village, Thanh Liet commune, Thanh Tri district, Hanoi. He was a prominent figure in propagating and educating Confucian ethics in Vietnam. At 16, he passed the 'Dinh Thi' exam but chose not to become a mandarin; instead, he opened a school in Huynh Cung village, near his hometown. In his early 20s, King Tran Minh Tong appointed him as a teacher at the National Academy, tutoring the Crown Prince. During the reign of King Tran Du Tong, due to his intolerance for corrupt officials, he retired to Phuong Hoang mountain, taking the alias 'Tieu An', focusing on teaching, writing, and studying medicine until his death.||||||After Chu Van An passed away (1370), a temple was built at the site where he taught. However, due to the harshness of time and the intense war bombings, by the 80s, the temple was almost completely destroyed. In the 90s, with the consensus of the authorities, the Hai Duong Museum, Van An Ward People's Committee, Education sector, and local residents carried out a major restoration and reconstruction.|||The result of the two renovation phases was that by 2008, Chu Van An's temple had become a complex of impressive and solemn architecture including: inner and outer tam quan, lower, middle and upper courtyards, a tree garden, two ceremonial houses, two stele houses, the main temple and 112 stone steps leading up to it, decorated with dragon and phoenix reliefs.|||The main temple is situated on high, spacious land, which according to feng shui, is the eye of the Phoenix bird. In front of the temple is Ngoc Mountain as a precedent, behind which is Phuong Mountain as a support, and on either side are Ky Lan and Phuong Hoang Mountains that seem to be bowing. The temple is built in the shape of the Chinese character for 'two' (二), a two-storeyed, eight-roofed tiled structure with eight curved corners, comprising five front halls and one rear sanctum. In the centre of the front hall is the communal altar, right behind which is the ancestral altar of the Chu family, on the right is the altar of the mountain god of Phuong Hoang Mountain, and on the left is the altar for the teacher's disciples. In the rear sanctum is a 100kg bronze statue of the teacher. The art of decoration in the temple follows the themes of 'four spirits' (Dragon, Snake, Turtle, Phoenix) and 'four precious things' (Pine, Chrysanthemum, Bamboo, Plum). The doors are decorated with gold and lacquer in the pattern of 'a dragon bowing to a blooming chrysanthemum'. In front of the temple are a pair of stone dragons in the architectural style of the Tran dynasty…|||In the serene and majestic space of the Chu Van An temple, nestled among the endless green pine forest, stands out the phrase “Vạn thế sư biểu”, and notably, a large calligraphic inscription of the word “Học” on the path leading to the temple. This is a manifestation of the gratitude of many generations of Vietnamese people towards the exemplary teacher Chu Van An. Another distinctive feature of the temple is that during their visit, besides offering traditional dishes, visitors also offer pens, books, and notebooks to pray for success in their studies and academic pursuits.|||The Chu Van An Temple is a spiritual and educational tourist destination for many visitors, officials, teachers, students across the country. Every year, a spring opening ceremony (a cultural beauty preserved since teacher Chu Van An came here to open a school) takes place on the 6th day of the Lunar New Year with 4 Han Nom calligraphy words: Chinh-Hoc-Thuuan-Hanh, and 10 national language words: Tam-Duc-Chi-Nghia-Trung/Tai-Minh-Tri-Thanh-Vinh; a autumn festival from August 1st to 25th (main festival on 25th); a memorial ceremony for Vietnamese Teacher's Day on November 20th; a source festival from November 24th to 26th (main festival on 26th).|||The temple was ranked as a national historical monument by the State in 1998.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/DenChuvanan03.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/DenChuvanan02.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/DenChuvanan01.jpg"

With a length of nearly 70m and many small chambers, Da Bac cave holds latent values and many mysteries of nature.|||Local legend has it that, in the past, heavenly fairies, bored with their divine life, descended to earth to explore. The breathtaking scenery captivated them, and they got lost in the Da Bac Lien Son cave. The stunning beauty inside the cave left the fairies speechless and amazed, as they had never imagined such a heavenly place on earth. The shimmering stalactites and curved stone arches seemed to enthrall them.|||The Jade Emperor, upon learning of this, was furious and sealed the heavenly gates to prevent the fairies from returning. Over time, the fairies transformed into part of the mountain wall. From then on, the Da Bac cave was also known as the Fairy Cave.|||Da Bac Cave was discovered in 1990 by locals gathering firewood. Initially, the cave entrance was a small crevice that only one person could enter. The locals then expanded the entrance for easier access.|||Walking into the cave, visitors will arrive at Co Tien Cave, which has two sections. The outer section is spacious with a high ceiling, featuring many stalactites hanging down like soft, velvet curtains. Over time, water drips from the stalactites, forming two natural pools filled with water. Behind the pools is a system of tiered fields carved by nature, creating a lively and dynamic landscape.|||The inner section is small, quiet, and serene, like a bedroom. The thin, soft stone strips hanging down resemble a screen. Even this simplicity makes one feel close to nature and the stone. When tapping on the thin stone strips, sounds like drums, bronze drums, or harp music can be heard. Visitors can sit for hours, calm and focused, letting their hearts converse with the stone.|||Leaving Co Tien Cave, visitors move to Long Tien Cave, where they will see a niche with a stone rim shaped by nature like a scarf draped over a girl's shoulder.|||During the rainy season, the balcony overflows with water. Stalactites hang down from the ceiling, and stone pillars rise from the balcony floor like ancient castles under the water palace. The pillars are intricately carved. Each arch and alcove is a strange work of art that leaves visitors speechless... Long Tien Cave leads to a side exit with daylight shining in, creating a soft, neon-like glow or flickering like a virtual moonlight. After bidding farewell to Long Tien Cave, visitors turn left about ten steps to reach Mau Cave. Upon entering, one is overwhelmed by a forest of stalactites hanging down in clusters, shining with green, red, purple, and yellow rays like colorful lanterns at a festival. Under the high and wide cave ceiling, a maiden lies on a stone wall, while nearby, Thach Sanh sits under an ancient mulberry tree. In the distance, a couple sits on a boat dock, whispering to each other. On the opposite side, Saint Giong rides a metal horse, holding a sacred tree branch, soaring into the sky. Next to him, Ton Ngo Khong brandishes his magic staff, fighting monsters... The Silver Rock Cave is a strangely artistic creation of nature. It combines elegant sculpture and painting, blending grandeur and vigor with poetic charm.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/31Dongdabac03.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/31Dongdabac02.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/31Dongdabac01.jpg"

"242","My Son Cultural Heritage","Location: My Son is located in Duy Phu commune, Duy Xuyen district, Quang Nam province, about 70km southwest of Da Nang city, and about 10km west of Tra Kieu in a secluded valley. Features: My Son is a Hindu sanctuary of the Champa Kingdom. The main temples in My Son worship a set of Linga or the image of Siva - The protector of the Champa kings.|||The inscriptions on the earliest epigraphs at My Son, dated to around the 4th century, mention King Bhadresvara building a temple to worship god Siva. Bhadravarman built a temple dedicated to Siva. Over two centuries later, the first temple made of wood was destroyed in a great fire.|||At the beginning of the 7th century, King Sambhuvarman rebuilt the temple using more durable materials, which still exist today. Subsequent dynasties restored old temples and built new ones to dedicate to their gods. With over 70 architectural structures made of stone and brick, built from the 4th to the 13th century, My Son became the most important architectural center of the Champa Kingdom. The deity worshiped in My Son is Bhadravarman, the king who founded the first royal line of Amaravati at the end of the 4th century, combined with the god Siva, becoming the main worship of the god-king and royal ancestor.|||In 1898, the My Son sanctuary was discovered by a French scholar named M.C Paris. At the beginning of the 20th century, two researchers from the French Far East, L.Finot and L.de Lajonquière, and the architect and archaeologist H. Parmentier came to My Son to study the inscriptions and the art of Cham architecture and sculpture.|||By 1903-1904, L.Finot officially published the basic documents on the inscriptions and architectural art of My Son.|||The precursor to this ancient architectural complex in My Son, according to remaining inscriptions, was a wooden temple dedicated to the god Siva Bhadravarman. However, towards the end of the 6th century, a fire burned down the wooden temple. The historical veil has been gradually lifted by scientists through inscriptions and historical records from various dynasties, revealing that My Son was the most important sacred site of the Cham people from the end of the 4th century to the 15th century. Using baked clay bricks and sandstone, the Cham people constructed a unique and interconnected complex of temples and towers over several centuries. The main temple enshrines the Linga-Yoni, a symbol of creative power. Adjacent to the main tower (Kalan) are other towers dedicated to various gods or deified kings. Although time and war have reduced many towers to ruins, the surviving artifacts and architectural remains still showcase the artistic styles of different historical periods of the Cham people, representing masterpieces that highlight the glorious era of Champa's culture and architecture, as well as that of Southeast Asia.|||Each historical period, the architecture bears its own unique style, just like each temple and tower worships different gods and kings, creating a distinctive architectural style. However, in general, Cham towers are built on a quadrilateral base, divided into 3 parts: The base of the tower represents the earthly world, solid and firm. The body of the tower is a symbol of the divine world, mystical and enchanting. The top part is often in the shape of people offering flowers and fruits in rituals, or leaves, birds, elephants, lions... animals that are close to religion and human life.|||According to researchers of ancient Cham towers, the architecture of Cham towers in My Son converges many styles; continuously from the ancient style of the 7th century to the 8th century; Hoa Lai style from the 8th to the 9th century; Dong Duong style from the mid-9th century; My Son style and transition between My Son and Binh Dinh; Binh Dinh style... Among the remaining architectural works when discovered (1898), there was a tower as high as 24m, in the area of Chua Tower, which archaeology books and research on My Son refer to as the ancient Champa tower, with 2 entrances to the East and West. The tower body is high and slender with a system of attached columns. Around it are 6 subsidiary towers, the whole tower complex spreads out like a lotus flower. The upper floor, the sandstone spire is carved with images of elephants and lions; the lower floor, the wall surface features people riding elephants and images of heavenly female water monsters. However, this valuable tower was destroyed by the US air force during the war in 1969. After discovering the ancient My Son tower complex, many typical artifacts, especially the dancing girls statues, deities worshiped by the Cham people, worshiped animals as well as community life scenes, were brought to Da Nang city and placed at the Cham Sculpture Museum. Although not many, these artifacts are representative works of sculpture art, they carry the cultural value of an ethnic group, but more than that, they are living and authentic historical testimonies of one of the ethnic groups in the rich cultural tradition community of Vietnam.|||My Son Sanctuary was restored by EFEO (Ecole Francaise d'Extreme Orient) from 1937 to 1944, but the site suffered severe damage from American bombing during the war. By 1975, out of 32 remaining monuments, only about 20 temples and towers still retained their original appearance. From 1981 to 1991, My Son Sanctuary underwent preservation and partial restoration with technical assistance from P.K.Z (Poland). Most of the sculptures from My Son were collected by the French and moved to Da Nang in the early 20th century and are now on display at the Cham Museum. My Son Sanctuary was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in December 1999.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/QuangNam/MySon/MySonSanctuary4.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/QuangNam/MySon/MySonSanctuary7.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/QuangNam/MySon/MySonSanctuary3.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/QuangNam/MySon/MySonSanctuary10.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/QuangNam/MySon/MySonSanctuary.jpg"

"253","Tay Dang Communal House","Location: in Tay Dang town, Ba Vi district, Hanoi, about 50km west of Hanoi city center. Characteristics: the communal house is known as one of the oldest in Vietnam with sophisticated carving and engraving art.|||The Tay Dang communal house was built around the early 16th century, but it still retains some carvings from the 11th to 13th centuries. This has led to speculation that Tay Dang communal house may have been constructed before the 16th century. The house of worship is dedicated to Tan Vien, one of the four immortal beings in Vietnamese folk beliefs, a key figure in ancient Vietnamese mythology.|||The communal house faces south. According to ancient beliefs, the direction of the communal house aims to honor Tan Vien Saint, considered the spiritual king of the village, contributing to maintaining a peaceful life for the people.||||||The Tay Dang communal house is a unique architectural work. The house has only one compartment in the shape of the letter 'nhat', without a back hall or front altar. The original building materials were entirely made of jackfruit wood, and some Son Lim wood was used during later renovations. In front of the house is a large open space for community activities on festive days.|||This is followed by a semi-circular pond placed right in front of the main gate. This is a common type of gate popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries.|||There are two side buildings on either side of a large yard, dating back to the same period.|||The main hall is built on a rectangular base with high stone steps. The hall has 5 rooms and 4 roofs. Inside, it is structured with 48 large and small pillars stacked in a tiered manner, divided into 3 main rooms and 2 ancillary rooms, surrounded by a veranda. Tay Dang communal house does not have a wooden floor nor walls around it; instead, it features a system of pillars supporting the roof, creating a spacious and well-lit area. The pillars are low and carved in a tapered style (narrower at the top and wider at the bottom), with a square base and a distinctive curved top. The roof structure is designed like a 'giá chiêng' with a larger, curved top part that directs force to the column heads and creates space for a central wooden panel.|||Tay Dang communal house attracts visitors not for its beautiful natural scenery or grandiose scale, but for its intricate wood carvings and decorations still preserved on the pillars, beams, rafters, and wooden boards. Here, visitors can admire the exceptional skill of the craftsmen who have achieved a high level of proficiency. The brilliance of the predecessors lies in the fact that over 1,300 wooden carvings in the house do not repeat any details and are arranged harmoniously, without symmetry like architectural details in many other communal houses. The carvings in Tay Dang communal house bear a strong folk cultural imprint, with themes focusing on the activities of people in Vietnamese villages in the 16th century, such as boating, carrying children, chopping wood, and dancing and singing… They reflect the thinking and intelligence of ancient Vietnamese people about life and labor.|||The Tay Dang communal house has a unique architectural decoration rarely seen in Vietnamese heritage: a decorative strip featuring laughing female fairies riding a dragon boat, connected by intricate floral patterns under the roof; the fairies are playing various musical instruments such as flutes, pipes, and different types of lute.|||The floral motifs include lotus and chrysanthemum flowers along with swirling patterns, carved on the pillars and beams with very delicate lines.|||The ends of the roof are curved and adorned with dragons, ly, quy, and phoenixes made of terracotta; the beams, supports, and brackets all have exquisite carvings.|||The most unique feature of Tay Dang communal house is the dragon carvings in Tran dynasty style.|||Visiting Tay Dang, tourists can be attracted and enchanted by dozens or even hundreds of dragon forms carved into round statues, placed on panels, columns, and serving as head ornaments.|||No other communal house or temple has such diverse and sophisticated dragon carvings.|||With its unique architectural and sculptural values, Tay Dang communal house is likened to a 16th-century folk art museum.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/25Dinhtaydang03.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/25Dinhtaydang02.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/25Dinhtaydang01.jpg"

Moluong Cave is an ideal tourist spot for visitors who love to explore and experience new things in Mai Chau.|||The cave is also known as Bo Luong, meaning 'large water mine', by the White Thai people. According to legend, during the Lunar New Year, the Thai people would go fishing in the deep streams in the area. One woman from Bo village caught a strange egg three times, and on the fourth catch, she decided to take it home to hatch. The egg hatched into a snake, which later turned into a dragon. The dragon brought prosperity to the village, allowing them to cultivate the land into fertile fields.|||To show gratitude, the villagers brought the dragon to Moluong Cave, where it turned into a dragon and stayed. Every year on the 15th day of the 7th lunar month, people see schools of fish swimming out of the cave for the villagers to catch. The villagers believe the fish are a gift from the dragon as a repayment of kindness.|||The cave has four chambers, about 500m deep. The first chamber is the largest, 60m long and 16m wide.

At the bottom of the cave is an underground stream flowing into Moluong lake.|||During the wars against France and America, the cave served as a base for Vietnamese soldiers to discuss strategies and store weapons and explosives.

"255","Son Dong Art Village","Location: Son Dong Village, Hoai Duc District, Hanoi, about 20km northwest of the city center. Characteristics: In 2007, Son Dong art village was recognized by the Vietnam Record Book as the largest Buddhist sculpture and worship object village in Vietnam.|||The traditional craft of woodcarving and making worship objects with lacquer and gold or silver leaf has existed for a long time in Son Dong. In 1983, Nguyen Duc Dau, a skilled artisan from Son Dong, established a class to teach wood carving and lacquer painting. Today, 34 students from that class have become skilled workers or teachers, continuing to pass on the craft to the younger generation in the village and commune.|||Son Dong village specializes in creating wooden statues and ceremonial objects with lacquered gold and silver finishes, serving the cultural and spiritual needs of the community. The wooden statues from Son Dong are crafted with precise proportions, resulting in balanced and uniquely distinctive pieces. What's remarkable is that the artisans from Son Dong can create any statue without needing a pre-existing model. From raw mit wood, the skilled hands of Son Dong craftsmen shape statues that seem to come alive, exuding a sense of soul. To achieve this, the artisans must possess experience, knowledge of Buddhist culture, and understanding of spiritual symbolism, as well as familiarity with the characteristics and placement of each statue in the cultural psyche.|||The crafting process involves not only a general method but also unique techniques from each artisan in Son Dong. The material used for making statues is mit wood, known for being soft, having fine fibers, being less prone to cracking, easy to carve, and having high durability. Mit wood is sourced from various provinces such as Phu Tho, Thai Nguyen, Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, etc., then processed to remove the sapwood, leaving only the core for carving. The artisan then uses a string to measure the volume and cuts the wood into the required shape. The initial processing stage focuses on the head and face of the statue. The artisan must carve an outline of the hat (if any), then the forehead, nose, lips, ears, etc. After outlining the overall shape from the face to the base, the artisan proceeds to detailed carving - the most crucial step in completing the statue. The next steps involve smoothing, scraping, and sanding to achieve a smooth surface. During the smoothing process, the artisan uses a flat, thin chisel to separate the details so that the parts do not stick together. This is the final stage for the wood before moving on to the painting process. The technique of applying son and gold leaf to the statue is as intricate as the lacquer art. First, the statue is coated with a mixture of paint and clay soil, then wrapped with raw lacquer and experimental lacquer. After each step, the statue is polished with stone and water. The process of applying and then polishing is repeated until the surface of the statue is flat, smooth, and rounded; then a layer of adhesive lacquer is applied. When the adhesive lacquer is dry to the touch (slightly sticky), the artisan proceeds to apply silver or gold leaf according to the customer's request.|||The sculptures from Son Dong are most famous for their antique replicas, used for the renovation of temples, pagodas, shrines and historical and cultural relics across the country. With their skilled hands, the craftsmen of Son Dong have created many highly sophisticated art pieces such as: The thousand-handed and thousand-eyed Goddess Buddha statue; Arhat statues... During the integration period, many Son Dong craftsmen also make portrait and art statues for export, meeting the demands of foreign partners.|||Today, visitors to Son Dong will witness the process of making statues and immerse themselves in the sounds of the craft village, with the chiseling of statues and the buzzing of saws echoing through the streets. In 2008, the People's Committee of Ha Tay (now Hanoi) approved a project to develop Son Dong traditional craft village combined with tourism by 2010, with an orientation towards 2020. The project aims to create a craft village that harmoniously combines modern production with traditional beauty in each statue, couplet, and horizontal board.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/24LNMNSonDong04.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/24LNMNSonDong02.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/24LNMNSonDong01.jpg"

The Dong Xuyen River (now Long Xuyen) only stretched to Ba Ban, and all traffic from Long Xuyen and the Mekong Delta to Rach Gia, Ha Tien, or vice versa had to take a detour via sea to Ca Mau. In 1817, when Thoai Ngoc Hau was appointed to guard Vinh Thanh, after conducting a survey and studying the terrain of the Long Xuyen quadrilateral, he decided to dig the Dong Xuyen - Rach Gia canal, starting at Ba Ban (now Ba Dau). His proposal was approved by King Gia Long, and the excavation began in the spring of 1818. The canal was dug along the old waterway, and after a month, it was completed. The canal was 61m wide and over 30km long, making it the earliest canal in the South. It played a crucial role in river transportation and agricultural development in Thoai Son District.|||When the canal construction was completed, King Gia Long praised Thoai Ngoc Hau and decided to name the river Thoai Ha (Thoai River). On the eastern bank of the Thoai Ha River, there was a mountain, commonly known as Sap Mountain, which the king renamed Thoai Son (Thoai Mountain) to reward Thoai Ngoc Hau's hard work.|||To commemorate this significant event in his life, Thoai Ngoc Hau wrote an inscription on the stele. In the third year of Minh Mang's reign (1822), Thoai Ngoc Hau solemnly held a ceremony to erect the stele at the altar of Son Than (now the communal house where he was worshiped as Thanh Hoang) at the foot of Sap Mountain.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/01Biathoaison03.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/01Biathoaison01.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/bia-ts.jpg"

Varella recognized the importance of Cape Dai Lanh on international sea charts. Therefore, on old maps, it was called Cap Varella.|||Cape Dai Lanh is special because it looks like a mountain and an island at the same time due to a freshwater stream separating it from the mainland, but it is actually connected to the land.|||The scenery of Dai Lanh Mountain has long been considered one of Vietnam's most beautiful landscapes. In 1836, King Minh Mang had the image of Dai Lanh Mountain engraved on a bronze artifact called Tuyen Dinh, one of 9 bronze artifacts placed at The Mieu in the Imperial City of Hue (Thua Thien - Hue). In 1853, during the reign of King Tu Duc, Dai Lanh Mountain was included in a national dictionary compiled by the royal court.|||Local people call Dai Lanh Cape Mui Dien, because on its peak lies a 26m-high lighthouse, over 100m above sea level, capable of emitting light signals 27 nautical miles away. The lighthouse is a cylindrical tower with an average diameter of nearly 5m, featuring 108 spiral wooden stairs inside leading to the top.|||This is one of 8 lighthouses over 100 years old out of 79 operating lighthouses in Vietnam.|||The lighthouse was built by the French in 1890 to guide ships operating at sea and into Vung Ro Bay. The lighthouse operated for 55 years before ceasing, then in 1961 it was restored by the former Saigon authorities. However, it was temporarily halted when Dai Lanh Cape was within the Eastern Front base area of the revolution, which was a corridor for receiving unnumbered ships. To block the revolutionary supply line by sea into Vung Ro, the US bombed the area densely, destroying the lighthouse. In August 1996, the State repaired and restored it, and the lighthouse officially operated again in 1997.|||At the foot of Mui Dai Lanh is Bai Mon. This is a fairly pristine beach, shaped like a crescent moon with a 400m long coastline, gentle slope, white fine sand, and crystal clear water. To the west of Bai Mon is a freshwater stream. After winding through many rocky cliffs and the primeval forest of Bac Deo Ca, the stream flows across the beach and empties into the vast ocean.|||The delicate combination of nature and human at Mui Dai Lanh - Bai Mon has created a stunning scenic spot that has been recognized by many domestic and international magazines, and is truly a precious asset of Phu Yen province.|||In August 2008, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism issued Decision No. 67/2008/QD-BVHTTDL, recognizing Bai Mon - Mui Dai Lanh (Mui Dien) scenic spot as a National historical site.|||Visitors to Bai Mon - Mui Dai Lanh not only get to explore and admire the scenery, participate in beach activities, but also enjoy fresh seafood such as shrimp, crab, fish, squid, oysters… Especially, tourists will have the chance to go fishing for the ocean eel - a very delicious sea fish that locals call the 'ocean serpent' and experience the mix of sweet and salty water streams.

"297","Ngo Mon Gate","Location: Ngo Mon is the main gate into the Imperial City within the citadel of Hue, Hue City, Thua Thien - Hue Province. Characteristics: Ngo Mon is one of the typical ancient architectural works of the Ngu River area.|||Despite enduring over a century and a half of natural storms and war destruction, thanks to skilful construction techniques and sophisticated architectural art, Ngo Mon Gate still stands firm, becoming one of the typical ancient architectural works of Nguu Song Huong mountainous region.|||Ngho Mon was built in 1833, when King Minh Mang renovated the layout and completed the overall architecture within Dai Noi.|||According to the I Ching, the king always faced south to rule the world. During the Gia Long era (1802 - 1810), when building the Imperial City of Hue, the architects designed the walls and palaces in a northwest-southeast orientation, which is also considered a north-south direction. The throne in the Thai Hoa Hall is the center of the overall layout, and Ngo Mon Gate is located to the south. Based on the la kinh (compass) of Eastern geomancy, the south belongs to the ""nguo"" direction on the ""ty nguo"" axis (meaning north-south). Therefore, Emperor Minh Mang named the new gate in the middle of the front of the Imperial City Ngo Mon Gate, replacing the old name Nam Khyet Dai. We should understand Ngo Mon Gate as the southern gate in terms of space, not time, and not as ""Noon time gate"" as some people have translated. Understanding the correct meaning of the name helps clarify the position of Ngo Mon Gate in the overall architecture of the Imperial City. This gate was usually closed all year round, only opened when the king entered or left the Imperial City with an escort, and during important receptions of foreign dignitaries in the palace...|||However, Ngo Mon is not just a gate, but a complex architectural ensemble. On top of it is Lau Ngu Phung, considered a ceremonial platform, used to organize some annual ceremonies of the royal court, such as the Truyen Lo ceremony (reading the names of successful candidates), Ban Soc ceremony (issuing the calendar), Duyet Binh ceremony... and it was also the place where King Bao Dai abdicated on August 30, 1945.|||In terms of architectural structure, Ngo Mon can be divided into two systems: the lower platform and the upper Lu Ngung Phung Pavilion. Although both have been designed to fit together tightly and harmoniously from overall to detailed.|||The architectural system of the base: Nearly 5m high, the base of Ngo Mon gate is built on a U-shaped square platform, 57.77m long at the bottom and 27.06m on the sides. The main construction materials are bricks, green stone and brass. In the middle of the base, three parallel gates are built: Ngo Mon gate (for the king), Ta Giap Mon gate and Huu Giap Mon gate (for mandarins following the royal procession). In each U-shaped wing, a passageway like a tunnel is built, running through from inside to outside, then perpendicularly to Dung Dao street. These two passageways are called Ta Dich Mon gate and Huu Dich Mon gate (for soldiers and elephants and horses following the royal procession).|||The five gates are built with arches, but the Minh Mang-era architecture at the two ends of the three middle gates features a system of horizontal and vertical brass beams with a section of 15x12 to reinforce the structure to support the Ngu Phung Tower on the platform. The more weight a section bears, the more beams it has and the closer they are to each other, meaning the beam density is higher. For aesthetic purposes, they added a thin layer of brass leaf to the outside of these brass beam systems.|||They showed great mastery in calculating loads, material strength, and in using suitable construction methods and materials.|||The upper floor features a front door made of leaves and bamboo blinds all around.|||However, it has many windows of different shapes: circular, fan-shaped, oval...|||The 9 roofs of Lau Ngu Phung can be divided into 3 rows, each consisting of 3 roofs: the main row running horizontally along the bottom of the U-shape and two auxiliary rows running vertically along the two wings of the U-shape. These two rows are called Ta Duc Lau and Huu Duc Lau.|||From the ground, people usually go up to the platform on two stone staircases on either side, which are exposed but discreetly located. Around the platform is a system of parapets decorated with various types of hollow, glazed, five-colored flower bricks.|||The Ngu Phung Tower system: The Ngu Phung Tower has two floors, the lower floor is larger than the upper floor. The frame is made of lim wood. The tower consists of nine sets of roof tiles glazed with gold and green, known as yellow glazed tiles and green glazed tiles. The tiles are arranged in a yin and yang pattern. The tower is built on a high foundation of 1.14m. The tower has 100 even columns, of which 48 columns run through both floors. The lower floor roof is simple, connected and running around all sides to protect from rain and sun for the surrounding corridors. The upper floor roof is divided into 9 different sets, with the middle roof higher than the other 8 sets. The lower floor has empty spaces around, except for the front center with a mirror door system, and a wooden partition on both sides and the back, where the throne is placed for the king to sit and attend ceremonies.|||The overall structure of Ngo Mon Gate was built on a U-shaped ground and the Ngu Phung Pavilion system was divided into 9 large and small roofs, varying in height, creating a delightful and airy appearance to avoid the heaviness of a relatively massive architectural structure. The foundation and platform system were built using hard materials (stone, brick, and bronze), but thanks to the elegant design, harmonious arrangement, and meticulous refinement, it still looks very light. The Thanh stone was polished smooth, and the bricks were baked thoroughly, mixed with molasses and tree resin in a high ratio, resulting in great durability.|||The walkways through the foundation and platform form long tunnels, but natural light still illuminates them sufficiently due to the elevated doors and additional decorative round windows in the shape of the character ""tho"". The wooden railings and balustrades (on the upper floor of Ngu Phung Pavilion) and hollow cast brick railings (on the upper platform) add to the elegance of the architectural complex.|||The roof areas, gables, and pediments of the pavilion are decorated with many images of dragons, Giao, bats holding golden coins, poetry, flowers, and leaves, making the roofs even more charming.|||Based on the measurements of all dimensions of the plan, elevations and sections, artist Pham Dang Tri has demonstrated that the overall structure as well as each architectural part of Ngo Mon gate were established according to the ""golden ratio"" of Western aesthetics; although architects in the first half of the 19th century only worked by their intuitive sense of beauty.|||On the other hand, the counts on the Ngo Mon architecture are also applied according to the principles of Eastern divination studies, such as the numbers 5, 9, and 100. The five paths symbolize the ""five elements"". The nine roofs of the pavilion represent the number 9 in the ""cửu ngũ"" hexagram in the I Ching, corresponding to the life of the emperor. The 100 pillars in the Ngu Phung Pavilion show that it is the sum of the numbers in the ""Ha Do"" and ""Lac Thu"" in the book.|||The number of 'Ha Do' is 55 (sum of numbers from 1 to 10: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10); the number of 'Lac Thu' is 45 (sum of numbers from 1 to 9: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9). Thus, the total number of Ha Do and Lac Thu (55+45) is 100. When it comes to Dich studies, we must mention yin and yang, because 'One yin and one yang is the meaning of Dao.'|||The yang number of Ha Do is 25 (sum of odd numbers from 1 to 10: 1+3+5+7+9); the yin number of Ha Do is 30 (sum of even numbers from 1 to 10: 2+4+6+8+10). The yang number of Lac Thu is 25 (sum of odd numbers from 1 to 9: 1+3+5+7+9); the yin number of Lac Thu is 20 (sum of even numbers from 1 to 9: 2+4+6+8)|||The two positive numbers of Ha Do and Lac Thu add up to 50 (that is 25+25); the two negative numbers also add up to 50 (that is 30+20). Therefore, the negative and positive of the I Ching are equal, both 50. That means: (25+25) + (20+30) = 100.|||In reality, if using the main axis of Dai Noi, which is Dung dao, to divide the layout of Ngu Phung Pavilion into two parts, we see that each side has 50 symmetrical columns.|||The philosophy of yin yang and five elements of Eastern philosophy is specifically reflected in the architecture of Ngo Mon. It is said that in our ancient architectural works, our ancestors have embedded many deep codes, cryptic messages, and profound intentions.|||Moreover, the empty space around the lower floor of the Ta Duc Lau and Huu Duc Lau reveals the slender rows of columns in the Ngu Phung Pavilion, creating a feeling of serenity, lightness, and pleasantness for the viewer.|||Overall, Ngo Mon Gate looks majestic and impressive from afar, resembling a magnificent castle. However, upon closer inspection, one can see that the architects during the reign of Minh Mang demonstrated exceptional skill in design and decoration. As a result, Ngo Mon Gate becomes a charming and lovely architectural work, blending harmoniously with the natural scenery and the soul of the people of Hue.|||Ngho Mon Gate is one of the most outstanding architectural works of the Nguyen Dynasty and Vietnamese ancient architecture.|||The architectural layout of the Ngu Phung Tower system perfectly matches the foundation platform system, as mentioned earlier, forming a welcoming gesture of the host stretching out to greet guests.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/ThuathienHue/NgoMon/Ngo-Mon-Gate5.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/ThuathienHue/NgoMon/Ngo-Mon-Gate4.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/ThuathienHue/NgoMon/Ngo-Mon-Gate3.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/ThuathienHue/NgoMon/Ngo-Mon-Gate2.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/ThuathienHue/NgoMon/Ngo-Mon-Gate1.jpg"

In 1929, Nguyen Sinh Sacc fell ill and was tracked by French detectives, so Abbot Le Khac Hoa took him to Dong Thap. According to the elderly in Minh Duc commune, the pagoda's name was changed from Tien Linh to Tuyen Linh in 1930 at the suggestion of Nguyen Sinh Sacc. Tuyen means propaganda.

The water god suddenly appeared, swept the girl away from her lover's arms, and pushed her into the rushing water. The young man panicked and jumped in, but lost sight of his lover. Filled with grief and hatred for the water god, the young man started collecting stones from Hoang Lien Son mountain to fill the stream. The stone mountain, blocking the Muong Hoa stream, grew higher with the young man's longing and sorrow. The Muong Hoa stream was split in two, flowing around Ban Den, murmuring day and night like the lover's call, ever since.|||Unlike the Muong Hoa stream, which has to carry water to dozens of villages along its path, the La Ve stream flows to Ban Den from deep in the high mountains and forests.

One day, they started throwing stones down the mountain. The stones piled up to form a small hill. The stream they bathed in flowed through the pile of stones. From then on, the stream and the hill existed in the world, at the foot of Co To mountain in the majestic That Son region.|||One day, the pioneers came here. They encountered a dry season, extremely thirsty, couldn't sleep at night, and suddenly heard the sound of dripping water. They discovered a cool stream flowing through the dry hill.

On festive days, monks and village elders bring offerings to worship the gods, heaven and earth, and then fetch the stream water back to the village.|||The reality of the steel mountain road|||The Southwest region is a fertile land with abundant fish and seafood, where everything is favored by nature. Tuc Dup Hill is gifted by nature with a dense system of caves resembling a giant beehive, connected by numerous passages and narrow crevices. Since the 1940s, Tuc Dup has been a hideout for communist fighters.

He was loved and respected by many not only for his strong physique and handsome face but also for his bravery and courage that few could match. They exchanged vows and became husband and wife, but the young man had to go to war and kill enemies, and many moon seasons passed without him returning.

Thanks to the help of Nguyen Thi Ngoc Thanh's family (from Nhi Chau village), the villagers could pay the workers, and the pagoda belonged to the village from then on.|||Le Hoan was impressed by Ngoc Thanh's beauty and made her his wife.

Thousands of comments from foreign visitors express their admiration for the intelligence and willpower of the Vietnamese people.|||The Vinh Moc tunnel system was dug and completed within 2 years, involving approximately 6,000m3 of soil and rock. The tunnel system has a total length of nearly 2km, divided into 3 layers: the first layer is about 13m underground; the second layer is about 15m; and the third layer is over 23m deep. It consists of 13 entrance and exit points that also serve as ventilation shafts (seven leading to the sea and six leading to the hills).|||The tunnel was designed as an underground village with 94 family units, including a freshwater well to support daily life, a meeting hall that can accommodate about 60 people, a notice board, a maternity hospital, a restroom, an operating room, a Hoang Cam stove (a type of stove that can be used underground with limited smoke emission), a rice storage area, a telephone station, an observation post, a guard station, and a bomb shelter.|||A strong impression when stepping into the Vinh Moc relic site is the large quote in the gallery: ""To be or not to be"", from Shakespeare's famous work Hamlet. This quote takes on greater meaning and evokes emotions in visitors when placed beside photographs: one taken in February 1965 showing a prosperous rural landscape with dense houses; another of the same village, but completely destroyed by enemy bombs; a photo of 11 children born in the darkness of war now gathered in the light of victory; and a picture of four female guerrilla fighters in white shirts, optimistic and singing in a tunnel, and then in military green, appearing on the surface to operate cannons against the enemy.|||The harsh reality of war here made people want to survive in only two ways: either leave or hide underground. The people of Vinh Moc chose the second option. ""To exist or not to exist"" was answered by the people of Vinh Moc by having 17 citizens born right in the tunnels in 1967-1968.|||Today, when visiting Vinh Moc tunnels, surrounded by lush rubber and pepper gardens on the fertile basalt soil, with the serene landscape of sea, sky, clouds, and harmonious water, few people can imagine that over three decades ago, this place was a steel fortress in the North of Vietnam, fighting against the intense destructive war of the American Empire for seven years (1966 - 1972). Vinh Moc was not only the frontline of the North but also a strategic location for gathering food and weapons to supply Con Co island, which is crucial for guarding the Vinh Linh sea area, 28km away. Therefore, the US dropped tens of thousands of tons of bombs and ammunition on this land. The invaders declared: ""We must bring this land back to the Stone Age!"" A destructive war was waged with the goal of ""extending the US border to the 17th parallel - the boundary between the two sides of Hien Luong bridge"". It's estimated that in one day, a local had to endure the equivalent of 500 heavy artillery shells.|||In 1976, the Ministry of Culture and Information recognized Vinh Moc tunnel village as a national historical site and listed it among the most important relics. To ensure visitor safety, the local authorities have restored and reinforced the tunnel sections that had collapsed with concrete and installed lighting along the passageways.|||","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/QuangTri/VinhMoc/VinhMocTunnels-9.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/QuangTri/VinhMoc/VinhMocTunnels-7.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/QuangTri/VinhMoc/VinhMocTunnels-6.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/QuangTri/VinhMoc/VinhMocTunnels-4.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/QuangTri/VinhMoc/VinhMocTunnels-3.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/QuangTri/VinhMoc/VinhMocTunnels-2.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/QuangTri/VinhMoc/VinhMocTunnels-11.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/QuangTri/VinhMoc/VinhMocTunnels-10.jpg"

People collected these feathers to make hats, which were durable and beautiful, and soon became popular. Later, when stork feathers became scarce, people turned to using rattan and bamboo to weave various products.|||Traditional Phu Vinh rattan and bamboo products are simple in shape but require skilled craftsmanship. To produce these products, artisans must go through many steps, from selecting and processing materials to crafting the final product. If the material is bamboo, it must be dried, then soaked in a chemical solution to prevent rot, and finally polished and dried again. The next step is to put the bamboo in a furnace, using straw or bamboo leaves to achieve the desired color. After that, the bamboo is taken out, cooled, and then straightened and shaped into thin strips. If the material is rattan, it must be dried and split into thin strips. The color of the products is varied, ranging from the natural color of the rattan and bamboo to colors achieved through the use of PU paint.|||Phu Vinh rattan and bamboo products come in hundreds of designs and types, some requiring high technical skill, such as portraits, landscapes, and ceramic products wrapped in rattan. Some Phu Vinh rattan products are preserved as rare and valuable art pieces, such as a Chinese character calligraphy piece woven from rattan at the Hue Palace Museum.

While living in Van Phuc, she taught the people how to raise silkworms and weave silk. To commemorate her, the villagers revered her as the tutelary deity of their village, worshiping her at Van Phuc village communal house.

Plain silk is smooth, soft, and luxurious. Embroidered silk has vibrant colors, elegant patterns, and intricate designs. To create these exquisite silk products, artisans follow a complex production process involving several stages: spinning, warping, weaving, dyeing, and drying. The process begins with selecting and processing raw silk threads to ensure they are white, smooth, and even. Only then can the threads be warped and woven using a loom. For plain silk, two types of heddles are used. For embroidered silk, artisans draw patterns on paper before weaving.|||The weaving process involves two people: one weaves, and the other installs patterns. The weaver plays a crucial role, while the other person assists by pulling the heddle. This technique is called double weaving to distinguish it from single weaving for plain silk. Not all silk is dyed; some is left white or given a subtle yellow hue. Some fabrics, like gấm and vóc, are dyed during the thread stage, while others, like lĩnh and the, are dyed after weaving.|||Silk weaving requires not only a complex production process but also creativity and skill from the artisans. The art of decorating silk with patterns is considered a model for the style of creating shapes on thin materials. The artisans have used traditional decorative themes from the national art treasure but with creativity, not stereotyping, to adapt to the weaving material, such as Ngu Phuc (five bats around the character for longevity), Long Van (dragon and cloud), Tho Dinh (incense burner and character for longevity), Quan Ngu Vong Nguyet (herons watching the moon), Hoa Loc (flowers on green shoots)... In general, the patterns woven on silk are symmetrically arranged, with lines that are not complicated but always soft, free, and decisive.|||Van Phuc silk products are diverse in color and rich in variety, including gấm, lụa, the, sa, xuyến, băng quế, lĩnh, đoạn, đũi, sa tanh, and more. Historically, Van Phuc silk was used for national costumes and was particularly popular during the Nguyen dynasty.|||It first appeared on the international market at the Marseilla fair (1931) and was praised by the French for its fine craftsmanship. Since 1990, Van Phuc silk has been exported to many countries, including France, Poland, Switzerland, and Cambodia.|||Now, Van Phuc has become a familiar destination in traditional craft village tours. Visitors can not only buy authentic Ha Dong silk products but also witness the production process by skilled artisans, especially at artisan Trieu Van Mao's workshop, which is the only one with traditional Van silk looms. Van silk is a famous, nearly lost, traditional silk type. It is a thin silk with embossed and debossed patterns. The embossed patterns are shiny, while the debossed ones are only visible when held up to light. Next to the workshop is a showroom with hundreds of silk products in various colors, such as scarves, clothing, handbags, and ties. The Van Phuc silk brand is a source of pride for the locals and helps preserve a part of Vietnamese culture.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/Luavanphuc02JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/icon/Luavanphuc02JPG.jpg"

The pagoda is one of the cluster of historical sites at the foot of Sam Mountain.|||Tay An Pagoda (Tay An Co Tu) was built by a Nguyen dynasty official during Minh Mang's reign (1820) - Governor Nguyen Nhat An - following his vow to build a pagoda to worship Buddha at the foot of Sam Mountain if he succeeded in his mission to Cambodia. After the pagoda was built with bamboo, he invited the first monk, Nguyen Van Giac, with the dharma name Hai Tinh, to be the abbot. In 1847, the pagoda invited another monk named Doan Minh Huyen, with the dharma name Phap Tang, to be the abbot.

"498","Sloping Wharf - Unnumbered Ship Wharf","Sloping Wharf was built by the French colonists with the intention of invasion but became the site where the last French soldier left the city. A long time has passed yet Sloping Wharf still stands marking a milestone in the nation's history of resistance against foreign aggression|||In December 1946 French colonialists returned to attack and occupy Do Son. At that time the French colonialists received support from the United States in various aspects such as money weapons and military equipment leading to their plot to expand the war intensify suppression sweep and terrorism to crush the people's resistance. To serve their long-term war plans besides using other ports built previously in 1950 they constructed a military ship dock at Do Son to accumulate and transport war materials such as weapons tanks amphibious vehicles from the open-sea cargo ships into storage therefore they built a sloping dock from the shore down to the water's edge to facilitate transportation and the locals commonly called it Bến Nghiêng (Sloping Dock).|||The people of Do Son have witnessed amphibious vehicles (called xe coc by them) from open-mouthed ships swimming from the sea into Ben Nghiep. Because Ben Nghiep was a shallow military port that could not accommodate large ships but was part of De Cat's plan, the French colonialists also planned to dredge channels to allow large ships to enter and exit. However due to fierce resistance from guerrilla units and military forces this plan of the French colonialists did not come to fruition. After the defeat at Dien Bien Phu under the Geneva Accords Hai Phong and Do Son were designated as 300-day assembly areas for French troops and on May 15 at Ben Nghiep a French military transport ship was already waiting to receive the defeated troops from Indochina. From then on Hai Phong and the North were free of enemy troops and from that day Ben Nghiep became a historical site commemorating the victory of the anti-colonial war against the French. Many elderly people in Do Son who witnessed that moment still vividly remember the image of the defeated troops with backpacks on their shoulders slowly stepping off the pier onto the ship marking the end of 80 years of French invasion of Vietnam.|||During the years of fighting against American invaders, especially the war against the blockade at Hai Phong ports, Ben Nghe played a crucial role in supplying oil and goods to Hon Dau lighthouse, which is considered the precious eye of the sea every night illuminating and guiding ships into Hai Phong port. Recognizing Hon Dau's importance, US imperialists intensified attacks to extinguish the guiding lighthouse, but from Ben Nghe, regular ship voyages continued to transport supplies to Hon Dau, and the Hon Dau lighthouse remained lit. After national reunification, Ben Nghe resumed its role in supporting production, fishing, and now serves as a tourist pier transporting visitors to Hon Dau, Cat Ba, Ha Long...

"504","Tuong Long Tower Temple","Do Son Tourist Area in Hai Phong is famous for its ideal beaches and picturesque scenery. However few people know that on the summit of Long Son (Ngoc Xuyen Ward) the first of nine mountains running along the Do Son Peninsula there is a historical and cultural site over a thousand years old—the Tuong Long Tower.|||Tower History|||Tuong Long Tower (also called Do Son Tower) was built during King Ly Thanh Tong's reign. This Buddhist architectural structure was built on a 2000 m² plot in Van Son Ward Do Son Town. All four corners of the tower lean inward at 190.|||Tower Features|||The tower's interior is hollow and houses a statue of Amitabha Buddha. The structure was built using bricks and stones of various sizes. In addition to construction bricks there are decorative bricks on the tower's exterior with unique motifs like lotus flowers chrysanthemums and citron blossoms. This decoration style represents the typical Ly Dynasty art.|||According to the ""Dai Viet Su Luoc"" in the year Mau Tuat 1058 King Ly Thanh Tong after traveling across the Ba Lo Sea stopped here to build the tower. Afterward he had a dream of a golden dragon and named the tower Tuong Long meaning ""Golden Dragon Appears"" to commemorate the auspicious omen. Some believe that the Do Son Sea Gate was one of the cradles that received the construction of this tower for Buddhist worship. In the past this site might have also been an observation post in the ""transmission lamp"" system. Whenever there was a crisis coastal observation stations would burn dry grass to send smoke signals to the capital as warnings.|||Tower Through Time|||From remaining artifacts it's evident that Tuong Long Tower was built contemporaneously with the Bao Thien Tower in Thang Long Imperial City (now the area of the Hanoi Opera House). According to the ""Dai Nam Nhat Thong Chi"" the old Do Son Tower was 100 chi tall built on a 1000 m² site with nine tiers and a west-facing entrance. One chi is 0.45 meters so the tower was approximately 45 meters tall. Located on a mountain 100 meters above sea level it was the tallest tower in Vietnam at that time. Tuong Long Tower was restored and renovated during the Tran and Le dynasties but in the third year of Gia Long (1804) the Nguyen court dismantled the tower to use its bricks for building Hai Duong Citadel. This shows that the ancient Tuong Long Tower was exceptionally grand and massive.|||From the Tuong Long Tower's location one can see the sea with boats heading out to sea to catch fish bringing fresh seafood for tourists as well as the Do Son Town with its villages and lush fields understanding how skillfully the ancients chose this site for the tower.|||Visiting Do Son without stopping at Tuong Long Tower would mean never forgetting the image of the majestic and splendid temple-tower regarded as the ""descending golden dragon"" tower.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/HAIPHONG/Chuathaptuonglong/unnamed.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/HAIPHONG/Chuathaptuonglong/Toan-canh-Thap-Tuong-Long-Do-Son-Anh-DN.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/HAIPHONG/Chuathaptuonglong/ThapTngLongSnHiPhong.jpg"

Legend says the stalactites at the cave entrance contributed to the name ""Phong Nha,"" meaning ""Wind passes through the teeth.""|||Phong Nha Cave has two sections: dry cave and water cave. The dry cave is 200 meters high. Geologists believe the underground river dried up long ago, leaving only white stone arches and emerald-green pillars. Stalactites in Phong Nha Cave formed over millions of years from karst limestone, dissolved by rainwater seeping through the cave ceiling to create unique formations like lions, golden thrones, and Buddhas. Rainwater continues to drip to the cave floor, depositing calcium to form stalagmites. Stalactites, stalagmites, and underground rivers in various shapes create a dazzling, majestic scene.|||Exploring Phong Nha Cave, visitors visit three representative caves: Co Tien, Bi Ky, and Cung Dinh. Each cave has distinct beauty. For example, Co Tien Cave has golden stalactites resembling a maiden's flowing hair.

It was a prosperous era for markets and bustling ports, with flourishing folk culture. Security and order were maintained with strict discipline. Economically, the Mac dynasty implemented agricultural promotion policies, prioritized land allocation for soldiers, and focused on land reclamation, village establishment, and dike construction. Unlike the early Le dynasty's 'agriculture-focused, commerce-suppressed' policy, the Mac dynasty adopted open policies for domestic and foreign trade, developing commodity production and connecting domestic markets with foreign ones. Mac dynasty's Hoa Lam ceramics from Bach Trang and Nam Sach were unique and exquisite, exported to many countries in the region. Crafts such as sculpture and bell casting were encouraged to develop.|||The Mac dynasty always emphasized examination policies and talent cultivation for the country (including for women). An assembly examination was held every three years.

Mr. Hoang a resident of Cat Ba confessed that he had been living in this village for over 10 years due to the naked incidents. On one occasion he brought herbal medicine to sell to the villagers and when he reached the middle of the stream he encountered a girl in the same state as himself.

If this house has something to attend to there is no need to report it the whole village comes to help. The belongings of this house can be freely used by others if they need them.

During the Trinh-Nguyen war, the Trinh forces occupied Deo Ngang, but the actual North-South boundary was the Gianh River. The northern bank had Ba Dung market where the Trinh forces bought food and traded goods. The southern bank had Nguyen dynasty fortifications built by Dao Duy Tu, such as Thay Fort (18km long) and Truong Duc Fort (10km long).

"547","Betel Leaf Village Vi Thuy","Vietnamese people are familiar with the saying ""A betel leaf is the beginning of a story."" In the daily lives of the people, betel leaves and areca nuts have become part of legends and poetry, closely tied to rural life in a warm and familiar way. This rural charm is still preserved in Betel Leaf Village Vi Thuy and has been passed down through generations.|||Betel Leaf Village Vi Thuy is considered the only remaining village specializing in betel leaf cultivation in the Mekong Delta. Betel Leaf Village Vi Thuy is located in Vi Thuy Commune Vi Thuy District Hau Giang Province this craft has been closely tied to the local people for a long time and has become a distinctive feature whenever Vi Thuy Commune is mentioned|||Currently Vi Thuy district has nearly 40 hectares of betel leaf with Vi Thuy commune considered the Betel Leaf Kingdom concentrating nearly 200 betel gardens covering about 32 hectares. Only in this freshwater area of Vi Thuy along the Hau River does betel leaf grow with rich flavor and delicious taste that stains lips red. Visitors to Hau Giang who come here are always impressed by the betel gardens with hundreds thousands of straight betel shoots green leaves slightly tinged with golden hues creating a beautiful sight.|||Trau Vi Thuy is golden betel with a spicy flavor that is popular among many people. After 3-4 months of planting, the betel vine will start producing leaves, and they are harvested once every half a month. Usually, traders come directly to the house to purchase the betel, transport it to various places, and deliver it to customers in the western provinces.|||To obtain a bundle of betel leaves (40 leaves), growers must go through several steps: purchasing seedlings, selecting trees for grafting, digging ditches, grafting, watering, harvesting betel leaves, and then arranging them into bundles called lien trau. This involves grouping the leaves into dozens (which can be 10 16 or 20 depending on the region) then into hundreds and thousands before delivering to traders.|||Speaking of planting methods, Nguyen Thi Nam, a betel leaf farmer, explains: whenever she sees a plump healthy betel shoot she buries it in the loose soil of the betel bed. After a short period when the betel vine takes root she cuts it and attaches it to a new stake. Betel is easy to grow grows quickly and requires minimal care. As it is a leaf crop if there is enough manure and water betel can be harvested after 3-4 months. Especially betel prefers natural green (organic) fertilizers and is not suitable for chemical fertilizers. Using traditional fertilizer (green manure) makes the betel leaves slender and shiny green with a slight hint of yellow making them more attractive.|||Betel nut growers state that saplings must be made from tram trees as the bark of tram trees adheres firmly to the trunk creating conditions for the roots of betel nut plants to attach and develop well. People usually harvest betel nuts early in the morning. When the leaves are ready for harvest betel nut harvesters select the shiny smooth leaves that are just ripe and golden while the remaining leaves will be harvested in the next batch about 10 days after the previous one. Growers must also build platforms to harvest leaves from above. When the tips exceed the platform they are cut off...|||Vị Thủy betel is both a traditional cultural element and serves the needs of many people in daily life and during festivals weddings etc. In addition to being consumed and used in religious ceremonies during festivals betel is also a medicinal herb studied for essential oil extraction applied in pharmaceutical and cosmetic production. Recently Vị Thủy betel has also been exported to several Asian countries generating significant profits for betel growers.|||Today, few people still chew betel nut, so the images of betel nut trees and betel leaves have gradually faded.|||But in Vi Thuy betel nut village, there are still lush, golden betel nut gardens that enchant visitors.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/HAUGIANG/LangtrauVithuy/4_.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/HAUGIANG/LangtrauVithuy/3_.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/HAUGIANG/LangtrauVithuy/2_.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/HAUGIANG/LangtrauVithuy/1_.jpg"

Some rumors suggest that in addition to burying members of the Dinh clan, this site may also be the final resting place of many servants of officials.|||In the 17th-18th centuries, Dinh Cong Ky of the Dinh clan achieved great merits under King Le Trung Hung. The Dinh clan was later renamed Dinh Cong. When Dinh Cong Ky was alive, it was said he was extremely brutal, cruel, and authoritarian. Upon his death, he was posthumously granted the title of Marquis. King Le Trung Hung even sent people to Thanh Hoa to fetch green stone tablets for his tomb. Descendants of the Dinh family later received similar stone tablets when they died.|||Many rumors claim that a Dinh clan official, after death, wanted to protect buried treasures and forced many young men and women to be buried alive. These young people, out of resentment, transformed into ghosts that harmed people. This superstition is one reason why no one dared to approach this ancient tomb.|||Previously, hundreds of stone tombs lay scattered in the area, creating a strange and eerie landscape of stone pillars of varying heights and sizes in a dense valley. Due to its 'dragon's eye' location—a favorable feng shui site—surrounded by wilderness and tall trees that blocked sunlight, the Ancient Dong Thech Tomb remained inaccessible and untouched for a time, until 1954 when the first archaeological and exploration teams arrived at this 'sacred site'.|||Today, despite being recognized as a historically and archaeologically significant site and a new tourist attraction, many mysteries of the Ancient Dong Thech Tomb remain unsolved. The site has also been reduced in size due to human activity. Many tombs still exist, but ancient Chinese characters on the stone tablets have faded, and some smaller tombs have been nearly flattened.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/HOABINH/MocoDongThech/Redsvn-Mo-co-Dong-Thech-11.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/HOABINH/MocoDongThech/Redsvn-Mo-co-Dong-Thech-06.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/HOABINH/MocoDongThech/Redsvn-Mo-co-Dong-Thech-02.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/HOABINH/MocoDongThech/Redsvn-Mo-co-Dong-Thech-01.jpg"

The Na Tu historical site in Cam Giang commune has been honored to welcome many high-ranking Party and State leaders, young union members across the country and tourists to visit.|||This was the military base of the 312 youth volunteer team, responsible for protecting Na Cu Bridge, a crucial bridge on National Highway 3 to ensure smooth traffic and serve the frontline.|||On March 28, 1951, a special event took place here between Uncle Ho and the youth volunteers.|||In June 1950, the Party Central Committee decided to launch the Border Campaign. To meet the requirements of the war, tens of thousands of young and healthy laborers were needed to serve the resistance.|||This force included young volunteers, civil servants who built roads, protected bridges, and transported food and ammunition for the goal of “all for the all-out victory campaign”.|||At that time, President Ho Chi Minh directly instructed the Central Committee of the Vietnam National Youth Union to establish a youth shock force to serve the battlefield.|||On July 15, 1950, a youth volunteer team was established.

To ensure traffic for the Viet Bac war zone, the youth volunteer teams were assigned to protect and repair National Highway 3, taking on the task of safeguarding and fixing this vital road for the resistance war.|||On March 19, 1951, President Ho Chi Minh directly went to the border region to inspect the road bridge repair from Thai Nguyen to Cao Bang, and visited youth shock troops and some transport units, warehouses along the route.|||On March 28, 1951, in Na Tu forest, the 312 youth shock troops were honored to welcome Uncle Ho. He was accompanied by comrade Tran Dang Ninh, Director General of Food. After shaking hands with the youth and inquiring with care, Uncle Ho unexpectedly asked: ""Are you girls and boys finding it hard to dig the mountain?"" The youth shouted in unison: ""Uncle, no"". ""Can you fill up the sea?"" A shy voice replied: ""Uncle, we have never seen the sea"". Uncle Ho smiled and said: ""Digging a mountain and filling up a sea are two difficult tasks. But if we have determination and willpower, we can do them"". Then, on the spot, Uncle Ho composed and recited four poem lines to the 312 youth shock troops.|||The event of Uncle Ho visiting the 312 youth shock troops in Na Tu and giving four poems is a great source of encouragement for young soldiers on the traffic front. The four poems Uncle Ho gave to the youth shock team were passed on by comrade Duong Thiet Son (then Secretary of Bac Kan Provincial Party Committee) who took Uncle Ho to visit the unit to the Central Youth Union and were composed into a song called 'Youth follow Uncle Ho's words' by musician Hoang Ha. Since then, Uncle Ho's teachings have become the guiding principle for the actions of generations of Vietnamese youth, always determined to strive to complete outstanding tasks, contributing greatly to the cause of national liberation and national reunification.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BACKAN/Natu/Ditichnatu01.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BACKAN/Natu/Ditichnatu02.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BACKAN/Natu/Ditichnatu03.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BACKAN/Natu/Ditichnatu04.jpg"

According to legend, in the past, people from Vi Huong - Bach Thong commune transported a gold Buddha statue of Shakyamuni down the Cau River to worship in their village, Hoa Son, at the top of the Phja Bjooc mountain range. The heavy gold statue required the use of a raft for transportation. However, as they reached Cao Ky commune, the raft started spinning and couldn't move forward. As night fell, the procession had to set up camp for the night. The next morning, they were shocked to find the Buddha statue missing. The procession then lit a large incense stick and prayed for the Buddha to show them the way to his new location. The smoke from the incense stick led them to a beautiful and spacious cave. The Buddha Shakyamuni was already seated at the highest point. Realizing the sacredness of the cave, the villagers built a pagoda within it.|||Thach Long Pagoda is divided into two parts: the first part, Thien Pagoda, is located on high ground with stone steps leading up to the cave entrance. The highest floor, Thuong Dien, symbolizes the heavenly realm and worships Buddha Shakyamuni. The middle floor, Trung Dien, represents the world and features an image of Uncle Ho. Inside the cave, the stone walls naturally form like a majestic canopy sheltering the Buddhas. This can be considered a masterpiece of natural architecture. The second part, Ha Dien or Am Pagoda, is accessed by walking around the mountain slope for about 80 meters. The entrance to Ha Dien is slightly narrower than Thien Pagoda, and the interior, though not as spacious, is about 6 meters high and 6 meters wide with a niche extending deep into the side.|||Thach Long Pagoda is not only rich in legends but also a historical site and a source of pride for the people of Cao Ky commune. Due to its unique structure and secluded location, during the Ly Dynasty, the pagoda was used as a fortress to fight against the Tống army. During the resistance war against France, the pagoda served as a production site and secret weapon storage for our military.

One year, a severe flood hit, and the raging waters swept away the old man's boat and nets. After the floodwaters receded, he cast his nets again. As the sun began to set, he finally caught a heavy load, but to his dismay, it was only a stone. On subsequent attempts, he still only caught that strange stone. He decided to move to another part of the river, but again, he caught the same stone. Just as he was about to discard it, a voice from within the stone said: 'Old man, take me home.' Finding this peculiar, he brought the talking stone back home. When he threw it to the ground, it collided with another stone, broke open, and surprisingly, a gold shine filled the inside of the stone. There were gold bars inside. Believing that the Jade Emperor (Giang) provided the gold to compensate for the flood's devastation, he distributed it to the people living nearby. Even with the gold, the old man and his son continued to work hard to make a living by the Trang Co river. Grateful, the locals built a temple to worship the two stones, the Mountain God and the Water God, so that boats passing by could have a safe journey.|||The Tham temple complex consists of the main temple, Co Tham shrine and Son than shrine.

She was admired by young men from all over the region. At a young age, she was taken by the lord of the region to be his wife. She lived a life of luxury but was filled with a hundred humiliations, especially when the Black Flag invaders came to harass, and the lord not only failed to resist but also collaborated with them. She found ways to escape and gather the poor to rise up against the invaders. The lord, consumed by resentment and a desire for merit, led the invaders to attack. The female general led the army bravely to fight back. A fierce battle took place at Trang Co River, with blood flowing like a river, but her soldiers remained unwavering.

Quan ho people are 'liền anh', 'liền chị' and always refer to themselves as 'liền em'. For Quan ho people, when guests come, they must:|||Lấy than, quạt nước tiễn trà người xơi.|||Trà này ngon lắm người ơi,|||Người xơi một chén cho tôi bằng lòng.|||And when it's time to leave, the farewell is difficult because the songs always seem to hold guests back:|||Người ơi, người ở đừng về...|||The Quan ho singing festival is often associated with temple festivals. Therefore, temples are where Quan ho people gather and welcome guests. There are 49 villages that sing Quan ho, located in four districts and towns in the south of Bac Ninh province. But when it comes to Quan ho, people immediately think of Lim Festival. Lim is the colloquial name for Lung Giang commune. The festival takes place on a hill where Lim Temple (Hong An Temple) is located. Lim Festival is the most crowded and famous among Quan ho festivals. The festival takes place on the 13th of the first lunar month, which is the first day of Lim Market.|||At Lim Festival, spring tourists can watch and listen to Quan ho singing on hills, behind temples, on boats, and in private houses; they can also listen to pair singing (male and female duets) or groups of males and females. Visitors can also experience other traditional cultural activities of the locality or participate in traditional games like swinging, cockfighting, bird fighting, wrestling, and communal games, which are heritages of ancient village festivals preserved by Lim Festival.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BACNINH/Lhlim/Hoilim01.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BACNINH/Lhlim/Hoilim02.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BACNINH/Lhlim/Hoilim03.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BACNINH/Lhlim/Hoilim04.jpg"

On the front beam of the Tien Te (Front Worship) hall, there is still an original Chinese inscription recording the restoration year 'Duy Tan Quy Suu nien' (1913). This is a unique and representative architectural work of the Nguyen dynasty that has been preserved to this day. The Dai dinh (main hall) has an architectural layout of 'square walls and a curved roof', with layers of curved and elegant roof tiles by the river. The frame of the communal house is made of precious lim wood, decorated with magnificent decorations and intricate carvings concentrated in the Tien Te hall.|||The artisans of Khuc Toai village have demonstrated their creative talent in this communal house using various artistic techniques: relief carvings, sculpted carvings, perforated carvings, and channel carvings.

The Tien Te hall has two central roof frames with a 'stacked rung' structure and the heads of the rungs are carved with flowers and leaves in a free-flowing style. The side rooms have roof frames of the 'pan me' type, with dragon and tiger head carvings.|||The dragon and tiger head statue aims to emphasize the majesty and sacredness of the communal house. The pillars are decorated with dragon heads holding beads with intricate carvings. The central room features two large dragons with complete details of head, body, and tail; however, the dragon scales are designed as blooming flowers and leaves. Twenty-seven pillars in the central room are carved with half-body dragons coiled in clouds approaching the communal house. The other seven pillars are carved with leaf-like dragons. The wooden door in the central room is carved with various themes from Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism, such as: Two dragons worshiping the moon, dragon descending, phoenix dancing, dragon and horse reading books, and precious objects… The woodcarving art of Khuc Toai communal house not only demonstrates the talent of ancient artisans but also conveys their aspirations for a prosperous and peaceful society.

On both sides are two rows of auxiliary buildings, each with five rooms. Behind the pagoda is a 4-room Ancestor's Hall. The main hall consists of 7 rooms and 2 wings.

Phuc Lam Pagoda is one of the largest pagodas in Phu Lam commune.|||Legend has it that Dao Dat and Dao Minh were two generals who helped King Thuc An Duong Vuong fight against the northern invaders. When the Co Loa citadel fell, the two generals retreated to Tam Tao village and opened a school. The current Giao Duong building was built by the people of Tam Tao village on the old foundation where the school was located, which was also the place where the two generals lived and died. To commemorate their merits, the people built a shrine to worship them.|||After Dao Dat and Dao Minh passed away, the villagers built a small shrine with five rooms next to the pagoda, generation after generation burning incense in their honor. Thus, it is very likely that the shrine to Dao Dat and Dao Minh was built immediately after the fall of Au Lac kingdom (around 208 or 179 BC). If counted until now, it has been nearly two thousand years old. This information also provides a basis to assume the time when Phuc Lam Pagoda was first built.|||In 2016, Phuc Lam Pagoda (Phuc Lam Tu) was recognized and granted a certificate of historical and cultural relic by Bac Ninh province People's Committee.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BACNINH/Chuaphuclam/Chuaphuclam01.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BACNINH/Chuaphuclam/Chuaphuclam02.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BACNINH/Chuaphuclam/Chuaphuclam03.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BACNINH/Chuaphuclam/Chuaphuclam04.jpg"

However, three princes, namely Dong Chinh Vuong, Duc Thanh Vuong, and Vu Duc Vuong, led their armies to surround Thang Long citadel to start a rebellion (known in old records as the Three Princes' Rebellion).|||Prince Buddha Ma entered Can Nguyen Hall from Truong Phu Gate and knew something was amiss. He ordered all gates closed and said: 'I have not wronged my brothers, but now the three princes are doing something unjust, forgetting the late emperor's teachings to usurp the throne.

Right after that, young men in the village and wrestlers from other villages come to participate in the competition.

These were the first folk songs of Quan Họ.|||Therefore, 'Queen Bà' is considered the ancestor of Quan Họ culture.|||Is it because of that, that until now, men and women from the same village are not allowed to marry, and have to be as unrelated as ""Vua Ba""? Is it because of that, that out of ten folk songs, nine talk about longing, yearning, asking, and melancholic rendezvous?|||Is it not so, that the poignant beauty of both those 'still destined' and 'no longer destined' is layered upon one another through the ages, like salt rubbed into the heart of those who have been wounded and not yet healed, since ancient times. Is it not so, that on that mat, six artisans: Ngo Thi Khu, 90; Nguyen Thi Vu, 85; Ngo Thi Lich, 82; Nguyen Thi Ban, 79; Ngo Van Su, 87, and Nguyen Van Bat, 86; play the roles of host and guest, to present a 'bowl of quan ho' from Diem village.|||One can say that the strictness in quan ho villages was created by the strict regulations that have been in place for a long time, and they have their reasons. Visiting Diem village, you can explore the Temple of the King and Queen, the ancestors of the quan ho village, which was originally built a long time ago but has undergone many restorations. The oldest architectural and sculptural mark that remains is a pair of stone ""sau"" on the body with clusters of cloud and spear leaves in the artistic style of the Le Trung Hung period. The later architecture belongs to the Nguyen dynasty, with the front of the Tien Te building still bearing the original Chinese characters: ""Hoang trieu Khai Dinh cuu nien"" (1924). By 2000, the temple was completely restored and rebuilt. The temple has a ""Vuong"" style architecture consisting of Tien Te, Thieu Huong, and Hau Cung, with a wooden frame decorated with carvings and ornate tile roofs.|||The King Ba Temple preserves many precious ancient artifacts, including a throne, statues, imperial edicts, horizontal boards, couplets, and other ceremonial objects.|||In the Tien Te hall, a large horizontal board hangs in the middle, beautifully decorated with lacquer and gold, featuring the four large Chinese characters 'Vương Mẫu giới phúc' (Queen Mother bestows blessings), with the inscription 'Khai Dinh Giap Tu' (1924) next to it.|||The couplets on either side of the pillars praise the merits of the Queen Ba: 'Vạn cổ cương thường Thần thị phục/Thiên thu hưởng hỏa cựu như tân' (Ten thousand generations of integrity, the gods still serve/For a thousand years, the incense fire remains as good as new).|||The rear palace is a place of solemn worship, with an altar and on it is a throne, a statue of Queen Ba and many other artifacts.|||The throne is made of wood carved with dragons, clouds, flowers and leaves, lacquered and gilded in the style of the Nguyen dynasty.|||The plaque with Chinese characters 'Đương cảnh thành hoàng quốc vương thiên tử nhữ nương Nam Hải đại vương' (The current virtuous queen of the country, the king's mother, the great queen of Nam Hai).|||The statue of Queen Ba sits serenely in the middle: sitting cross-legged, her hands resting gently on her lap, her head wearing a crown adorned with flowers; her face is beautiful and benevolent, with long ears, a neck with three folds, and a necklace; her outer robe is soft and smooth.|||On the altar are other precious ancient artifacts such as incense burners, loc binh, water vessels, lampstands, candlesticks, and a notable trio of red lacquered wooden balls placed beside the throne, which are associated with the 'cướp cầu' (stealing the ball) custom of the Queen Ba festival.|||There is also an imperial edict from the year Thieu Tri 4 (1844), conferring a title on the person being worshiped.|||The people of Viam Xa village are always proud that: ""Our ancestral origin of Quan Ho/ The lyrics were born by Our Lady/ Since ancient times, young and old/ Anyone who can sing is honored."" Specifically, the villagers of Viam Xa have preserved the most ancient customs about the lifestyle of Quan Ho at the Temple of Our Lady such as: Whenever there is a drought, there is a tradition of singing Quan Ho to pray for rain, and when singing, only Quan Ho groups from the village are allowed to sing and only sing traditional melodies (ancient voices). On the other hand, according to travel experiences in Bac Ninh, only Viam Xa village has preserved the oldest Quan Ho customs such as: singing Quan Ho covered head, communal house tradition, communal sleeping, making friends, making chạ… Viam Xa is a village with many generations of Lien Anh, Lien Chi, and famous folk artists who understand Quan Ho etiquette and can sing the most traditional melodies in the region. All festivals of the temple, communal house, and pagoda of the village all stand out with Quan Ho cultural activities and attract many Lien Anh and Lien Chi Quan Ho from surrounding villages to participate in the festival.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BACNINH/Denvuaba/Denvuaba01.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BACNINH/Denvuaba/Denvuaba02.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BACNINH/Denvuaba/Denvuaba03.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BACNINH/Denvuaba/Denvuaba04.jpg"

Visiting Dong Ky during the festival, one can listen to Quan ho singing on boats all day on the 4th day and in the mornings of the 5th and 6th days. This is also an opportunity for the village's Tuong theatre troupe to perform for the villagers. The Tuong performances take place right in the communal house's yard; every night, the village stage is lit up, and sometimes in the afternoon, the sound of Tuong drums echoes, urging people to come and watch. Notably, both Quan ho and classical Tuong performances are performed by the villagers themselves.

He took Long Nu, the daughter of Dong Dinh Quan, as his queen, and they had Sùng Lãm as their child.|||In 2789 BCE, the country was renamed Xich Quy, then lost. Sung Lam succeeded his father, styling himself Lac Long Quan. Lac Long Quan married Au Co and had 100 sons, the eldest of whom inherited the throne and was called Hung Vuong, or strong king.|||Growing up, King Hung Vuong saw that Luu Lau land was open, with high ground to attack from, but no retreat if defeated.

The male singers, wearing khăn xếp hats and áo the shirts, sing Quan ho melodies to welcome guests from afar.||||||The King and Queen Festival takes place on the 6th and 7th days of the second lunar month.

As she approached marriageable age, many suitors came to ask for her hand. Her father organized a tournament to choose a son-in-law.

The performance includes solo and humorous verses with content about male and female romantic interactions.||||||The Hoi Diem festival begins with the ceremony of opening the gate of the Vua Ba temple (the mother of quan ho folk songs).

The citadel covers an area of 545,000 m2, with a 9-foot high wall made of earth and stone, later replaced with stone and brick, surrounded by a deep moat. The citadel has four gates, each with a bridge crossing the moat, and inside the citadel are arranged various sections including the Office of the Town Governor, the Watchtower, the Gunpowder Depot, and the Communal House.|||According to historical records, during the Nguyen dynasty, Bac Ninh Ancient Citadel was the center of the administrative machinery of the two provinces of Bac Ninh and Thai Nguyen. During the French colonial period, recognizing the importance of this citadel, on May 16, 1925, the Governor-General of Indochina signed a decision to rank the Bac Ninh citadel as a typical architectural and artistic work. In August 1945, after the Japanese occupation, the people of Bac Ninh surrounded the Japanese army in the citadel, conducted a revolution to seize power, and forced the Japanese to return the citadel.|||In the history of Vietnam's struggle, Bac Ninh Ancient Citadel was a particularly important military position, located in the northern defense line, protecting the Capital, and blocking invading armies at the gate of Thang Long Citadel. It was also a political and military center, and the seat of the Kinh Bac province (now Bac Ninh province).|||Bac Ninh Ancient Citadel is also a place that marks events associated with the development of the province and the revolutionary movement of Bac Ninh province led by our Party.|||In 1980, the Bac Ninh Ancient Citadel was ranked as a historical and architectural monument by the Ha Bac Provincial People's Committee and handed over to the Bac Ninh Town People's Committee (now Bac Ninh City) for management. In 2005, the Bac Ninh City People's Council passed Resolution No. 23/NQ-HDND on the preservation and promotion of the historical value of the Bac Ninh ancient citadel.|||However, up to now, the citadel has not been restored or renovated; especially the human impact has caused the monument to deteriorate seriously. The remaining vestiges of the Bac Ninh Ancient Citadel are three gates, a part of the wall and a deep moat, two cannons, and notably the front gate with a watchtower and a nearly 20-meter high flagpole.|||These values and the current state of the Bac Ninh ancient citadel in particular and other cultural heritage in general pose an urgent requirement to build a conservation plan and promote cultural values, and mobilize resources to implement the strategic goal of making Bac Ninh a centrally-affiliated city.

As Tet arrives and spring unfolds, trees and flowers seem to burst with vibrant life, marking the season of leisure and enjoyment. Traveling to Bac Ninh, in the Kinh Bac region, where traditional values are preserved, one can find ancient temples and unique festivals.|||While the Lim Festival is famous for its young couples in traditional attire, with turbans, long dresses, conical hats, and delicate silk scarves singing sweet and charming songs.|||The Dong Ho village festival, on the other hand, attracts many tourists with its folk paintings.|||Mentioning Dong Ho village, Song Ho commune, Thuan Thanh district, Bac Ninh province, people immediately recall the traditional folk painting craft of the village. Dong Ho village is located right on the banks of the Duong river, once only separated from the river by a dike, as expressed in the saying 'Having a river for a refreshing bath and a profession of making paintings'. Nowadays, due to the accretion of the river, the distance from the dike to the water's edge is quite far. The Dong Ho village festival has also been held for a very long time, organized annually. Similar to other villages, the Dong Ho village festival involves worshiping and commemorating the village's tutelary deity. Additionally, the festival resembles the ancestor's death anniversary of the painting craft in the village. At the festival, artisans have the opportunity to exchange and discuss the craft of making paintings.|||The craft of painting is closely associated with the communal house, a ancient communal house where villagers worship their tutelary deity. Notably, this communal house, while still serving as a common shelter for the community, has become unique due to its close connection with the painting craft. Therefore, it is often referred to as the 'Painting Communal House'. It was built by Dong Ho folk artists approximately three hundred years ago.|||The communal house, located on the west side of Dong Ho village, faces north. Initially, it had 7 bái đường sections and 2 hậu cung sections, with two rows of thảo xá on either side (5 sections each). The communal house was destroyed by the French in 1950. Today, it only has 5 bái đường sections and 2 hậu cung sections. The architecture follows the 'Đinh' style.|||The temple gate, built in the 'Tam Mon' style, features three arched entrances with curved roofs. Adjacent to the gate is a semicircular well, surrounded by brick walls and a raised edge with steps for easy access.|||The philosophy of yin-yang symmetry and harmony, as well as the charming scenery of Dong Ho village, is likely embodied in the incorporation of the semicircular well into the overall design of the village temple.|||The communal house still preserves many precious artifacts such as: Worship items, Incense altars, Large signboards, horizontal lacquered boards, A set of eight precious items with lacquered and gilded decorations... On the communal house yard are two stone steles, the inscriptions on which commemorate the village's virtuous scholars and those who made significant contributions to the construction of the communal house...|||Particularly, according to travel experiences in Bac Ninh, this is also where the annual painting markets take place with diverse and colorful folk products that are not only attractive but also unique. Visitors here buy their favorite paintings as souvenirs.|||The village festival is usually held over three days: the 14th, 15th and 16th of the third lunar month. At the communal house yard, women wearing ao dai perform a ritual of the festival.|||Stepping inside, some tourists are impressed by the oversized paper offerings, including a horse and a boat, which are placed in an easily observable position.|||Inside the communal house, there are many paper offerings, ranging from exquisitely crafted items like gold and silver trees to common paper offerings for worship.|||From early March, people in Dong Ho village start making gold and paper products to display at the festival. Preparing for the festival, each family is assigned to make an item. The process of making items is an opportunity for families to gather, share everyday life and work. In the past, Dong Ho village had 17 different families living and working on paintings. But today, since paintings are not sold, most families have switched to making paper products, only a few families still keep the traditional job. During the festival, people display and sell traditional Dong Ho paintings in the communal house yard. A paper bridge is built in the communal house, symbolizing exchange and harmony. The festival also has traditional rituals such as worshiping gods, horse racing, and painting competitions, which are very joyful.||||||The village also has folk songs such as:|||Oh traveler on the main road|||Stop and gaze at the scenery, your melancholy fades away|||Buy a fresh colorful butterfly painting|||Buying chickens and pigs that lay eggs and give birth in large numbers.|||The painting contest at Dong Ho Village communal house can be said to be a unique folk cultural activity.

Wherever the dragon goes, it is warmly and respectfully welcomed by the people.|||The festival's entertainment part is lively with many traditional games and performances, such as dragon dances, lion dances, swinging on swings, singing, and competing for the decorated cannon. The most notable game of the festival is the competition to grab the decorated cannon head, which is made from an iron hoop with colorful streamers. The cannon head is placed on a high platform, and after the cannon is fired, the teams compete to catch the head. The team that successfully brings the cannon head to the Organizing Committee wins. Recently, due to the ban on fireworks, the Organizing Committee has modified the game by throwing the iron hoop from the high platform for the teams to compete and catch. According to local people's beliefs, whoever catches the lucky cannon head will have a year filled with good luck, prosperity, and bring great honor to their commune. The winning commune will receive a roasted pig on a litter during the procession of the gods, and the litter will be left for that commune to worship and pray for luck throughout the year until the next festival.|||Over time, the Quang Uyen fireworks festival has existed in the consciousness of many generations of Quang Uyen people and has become a spiritual beauty that cannot be missed each spring.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/CAOBANG/Lhphaohoaquangyen/LhphaohoaQY01.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/CAOBANG/Lhphaohoaquangyen/LhphaohoaQY02.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/CAOBANG/Lhphaohoaquangyen/LhphaohoaQY03.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/CAOBANG/Lhphaohoaquangyen/LhphaohoaQY04.jpg"

According to one story, the lord went to retrieve a bronze drum and stopped here, exhausted, to sleep. Mice then gnawed through the drum's ropes, causing it to roll down the hill and produce a loud sound that echoed throughout the region. The other lords, believing that the lord who went to retrieve the drum had won, abandoned the contest, and thus no one emerged victorious. 'Dong Lan' is believed to be a corruption of 'Tong Lann', meaning 'drum rolling'. Another hypothesis suggests that the name 'Dong Lan' refers to the pagoda's location on a hill shaped like a Lân.|||During the Ly Dynasty (late 11th century), Dong Lan Pagoda was built to worship Buddha.|||In the year of Tan Hoi, Can Thong 19th era of the Mac Dynasty, the queen ordered the construction of the pagoda in the shape of the letter ""ding"", with two corridors and a back hall, monk quarters.|||Behind the pagoda is the Ly Cung of the Mac family.|||The pagoda was a place for the queen and princesses to chant sutras and pray to Buddha.|||Before the temple was built, on Dong Lan hill, there was a shrine to Tran Quy and Tran Kien.

The tower has 3 doors opening to the East, North and South, with the southern one being a window. The function of the tower is for Brahmin monks and priests to arrange offerings and keep the sacrificial fire, so the Cham people call it the Fire Tower.|||What's special is that the tower structure is built with a roof in the style of a house roof (similar to the prong house in the Central Highlands or the boat-shaped roof like the top of a bronze drum).|||Behind the main tower, there is a shrine dedicated to Queen Kut, also known as To Ly.|||South of the tower complex, outside the wall, stands a 2.20m high stone pillar (Linga).|||Northeast of the tower complex, outside the wall, there is a three-sided stone with ancient Cham inscriptions.|||Every year on the last day of the 6th month and the 1st day of the 7th month in the Cham calendar (around September or October in the Gregorian calendar), thousands of Cham people hold a solemn ceremony at the three towers of Po Klong Garai, Po Rome, and Po Inu Nagar.

Seen from afar, Eo Gio looks like a saddle, situated between two high mountains by the sea. From above, it resembles a funnel. The location always has strong winds blowing from the sea. In winter, the sea is rough with heavy rain and strong winds. The sea waves crash against the rocks, creating grooves and forming steep cliffs over time. These natural elements have created a pristine and majestic beauty.|||From the top of Eo Gio, visitors can see the entire island commune of Nhon Ly. They can observe fishermen at work, people buying seafood, Phuoc Sa temple with its beautiful architecture, and the Quan Am statue on the mountain, watching over the local fishermen.

"740","Thach Ky Dieu Tau","Located 16km northeast of Quang Ngai city center, Thach Ky Dieu Tau rock (An Vinh village, Tinh Ky commune) is one of 12 famous scenic spots in Quang Ngai province, with a unique beauty and many interesting things. This place is likened to a work of art arranged by stone, a masterpiece of nature with traces of volcanic activity and the process of sea advance and retreat millions of years ago...|||Thach Ky Dieu Tau rocky reef is located on the southern bank of the Sa Ky estuary. It was formed by volcanic activity that erupted and flowed into the sea millions of years ago, creating this natural rock barrier across the mouth of the sea.|||From above, the reef is not far from the prosperous An Vinh village and is separated from the village by a lush green forest of poplar trees.|||When viewed on a map, this area resembles the foot of a giant stepping out. The position of the foot is exactly where the reef has a shape like 5 toes protruding into the sea.|||The reef consists of stacked rock masses stretching for kilometers, constantly pounded by waves, with foam swirling around it, and hidden beneath the jade-like clear water, creating a rare, pristine, and majestic scene.|||Notably, about 15-20 meters from the shore, a rock formation juts out into the waves, resembling an old man sitting fishing. Nearby, a boulder bears the impression of two gigantic footprints. Adjacent to this is a cave-like structure, open at both ends, at the same level as the tide.|||Every time a wave hits one end of the cave, water shoots out from the other end, leading locals to imagine it as a giant's wine cauldron. For centuries, they have shared tales of a giant who allegedly carried stones to block the sea entrance.|||When almost done, the carrying pole broke, which is now the entrance to Sa Ky port. The piles of stones on either side of the gate today are An Hai and An Vinh capes.|||On them, one can still see the clear footprints of the giant and his wine cauldron.|||The name Thach Ky Dieu Tau is explained by researchers as follows: the word 'ky' in 'Thach Ky Dieu Tau' means a rocky reef or an underwater boulder, also implying water crashing into rocks. According to the book 'Quang Ngai tinh chi' (published in 1933): 'Thach Ky Dieu Tau: At the Sa Ky gate, there is a rocky reef protruding into the sea, which from a distance looks like a human figure, hence the name.' Local people in Son Tinh have long been familiar with a simple name: Lao cau ghanh da. Regardless of the name, Thach Ky Dieu Tau still possesses a pristine and charming beauty.||||||When visiting Thach Ky Dieu Tau, tourists should choose two of the most beautiful times of day to admire the scenery: sunrise or sunset. At these two times, thanks to the special lighting, the scenery of Thach Ky Dieu Tau becomes even more magical. If you're lucky enough to visit during the moss season, you'll get to see a Thach Ky Dieu Tau with a fresh green color, full of vitality, with moss covering the dark, rugged stones that are millions of years old. Unlike the Da Dia rock formation in Phu Yen with its evenly arranged hexagonal stones, Thach Ky Dieu Tau consists of rocks of diverse shapes and sizes, clearly reflecting the erosion process of nature and the activity of the volcanic system in the past. This is also a characteristic of the rocky shores and sea in Quang Ngai.|||Not only can visitors enjoy the fresh air and peaceful scenery, but they can also experience many interesting activities at Thach Ky Dieu Tau such as: Camping; swimming in the ""mini swimming pool"" which are deep pools on the rocky shore; catching sea urchins, fishing, picking seaweed or learning about the life of An Vinh villagers. Visitors can also taste special seafood like Huynh De crab, sea eel, mullet, and red snapper... cooked to the locals' taste.

C1 Fortress was located at an altitude of 493, among A1, D1, D3 strongpoints with a height of 50m and gentle slopes. Here, the French colonialists deployed Company 3, Battalion 1, Infantry Regiment 4 of Morocco to guard. In addition, there was the support of the 6th colonial parachute battalion, the 5th Nguyen battalion, and one company of the 8th shock parachute battalion, under the direct command of Bigeard, Deputy Commander of the Central Subsector.|||For the Vietnam People's Army, Battalion 215, Regiment 98, Division 316, led directly by Regiment Commander Vu Lang, was assigned the task of attacking and destroying strongpoint C1.|||C1 Hill is a strategically important stronghold. Capturing it would provide the Vietnamese People's Army with a foothold to advance to strongholds C2 and A1, posing a serious threat to the French forces on the eastern highlands. Therefore, both the Vietnamese People's Army and the French forces made efforts to consolidate their positions on this hill. The two sides engaged in 12 intense and protracted counterattacks, fiercely contesting every inch of land, every gun emplacement, and every stretch of trench, but neither could gain a decisive advantage.|||On 30 March 1954 at 5pm, the Vietnam People's Army launched the second attack on Dien Bien Phu stronghold.|||The Vietnamese army's artillery fired intensively at the Eastern hills, including hill C1.|||The 215th Battalion, 98th Regiment, 316th Division quickly approached the target, using explosive charges to clear a path through 7 layers of barbed wire.|||During the battle, comrade Vu Lang, commander of the 98th Regiment, called for the artillery to cease fire and seize the opportunity while the French forces were paralyzed.|||The battalion commander, Bui Huu Quan, ordered the infantry to charge.|||To organize an effective attack, company commander Le Van Di had the initiative to dig a 20m-long underground tunnel from the Vietnamese army's position to the French flagpole.|||From this tunnel, they captured bunker No. 3 and used it as a base to throw grenades at the French forces.|||With just one swift charge, after 10 minutes the 38th Company had captured the bunker on the hilltop. Team Leader Nguyen Thien Cai planted the ""Decisive Fight, Decisive Victory"" flag on the flagpole. The battle lasted 45 minutes, during which the Vietnam People's Army annihilated and captured the entire company of 140 French soldiers from the 1st Battalion, 4th Moroccan Infantry Regiment who were guarding it, temporarily taking control of outpost C1.|||At the Command Post, Colonel Vu Lang called and ordered Captain Le Van Di to pull back 200m down the hill, leaving only one platoon as a reserve for the Vietnamese artillery on Doi D hill to fire at the French battlefield before the 811 company charged. After consideration, Captain Le Van Di decided to pull back one reserve platoon 200m, while the rest of the unit still held their ground, reasoning that their well-built positions could withstand the artillery bombardment. If they retreated too far, they would lose the initiative and surprise, and the French artillery in Hong Cum would have time to fire and cause casualties to the Vietnamese army, while the French in C1 would have time to regroup and counterattack. On the night of May 1, 1954, after 32 days and nights of defensive fighting at outpost C1, the 98th Regiment of the 316th Division completely captured the high ground C1, paving the way for other units to attack and destroy the remaining outposts of the eastern wall. The bold and wise decisions of Captain Le Van Di contributed to the victory at outpost Doi C1, opening the way into the center of the Dien Bien Phu fortified complex.|||The C1 Hill relic is one of the component sites of the Special National Historical Site of the Dien Bien Phu Battlefield.|||It is a glorious testament to the great victory of the Vietnamese military and people during the resistance war against French colonialism.

When they ran out of materials, they would destroy villagers' homes to obtain wood. Furthermore, they forced people from nearby villages around Doc Lap hill to relocate to Mo village (in Thanh Nua commune), several kilometers away, as they suspected the locals of hiding Viet Minh members.|||On March 15, 1954, the 312th and 308th divisions of the Vietnam People's Army defeated and liberated the Doc Lap stronghold.

Since he knew Mr. Le was a biology researcher, his Japanese partner gave him 10 cherry blossom seeds to grow in Vietnam. Although his company has many branches in several provinces, he decided to bring the seeds to Muang Phang to test the growth because the soil conditions here are quite suitable, and also because this is a historical land with much significance. With 10 seeds, from 2006 he grew 9 trees, of which his Japanese partner took back 5. The remaining 4 trees were planted on ""Flower Island"", and after 3 years, they started to bloom and bear fruit.|||However, since they were grown from seeds, the flowers have changed and no longer retain their original color. From these initial trees, Mr. Le grew 500 more trees which are currently planted in the garden, of which 40 trees from the first batch are now blooming. With 5 hectares of land assigned to him, Mr. Tran Le plans to cover the entire ""cherry blossom island"" in the middle of Pa Khoang lake.

At the foot of the mother waterfall is a wide, deep, and blue-green pond. Looking closely at the water, you can see small fish swimming underneath. Being immersed in the clear water on a hot day is unbeatable. The mother waterfall is nearly 20m high, pouring white water down into the pond. From a distance, the waterfall's flow seems moderate, but up close, you realize the water pours down strongly into the green pond, so if you want to experience this 'strong sensation,' remember to bring a life jacket when swimming.|||Around the pond, there is a comfortable area of land, very suitable for camping or setting up a barbecue.

The first theory is that it comes from 'la vang', which means 'la vang leaves', written without diacritics. This type of leaf is abundant in the area. When the locals were struck by an epidemic, the Virgin Mary appeared and instructed them to find the la vang leaf, which would cure their illness when consumed. This leaf is good for health and is still widely used today.|||Throughout the history of La Vang Sanctuary, priests had built a few small chapels for worship and to honor the Virgin Mary. However, it wasn't until February 11, 1924, the Feast of Our Lady of Lourdes, that the priest of Co Vu, Morineau, announced the construction of a large church in La Vang, designed by architect Carpentier, with a minimum budget of 20,000 dong. After four years of construction, the grand La Vang Sanctuary was completed in 1928, except for the bell tower.|||Today, La Vang in Quang Tri has transformed from a remote area over 200 years ago into a major Catholic pilgrimage center with many impressive structures built to honor the Virgin Mary, where devotees can stay and pray for days.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/QuangTri/thanhdialavang/lavang1.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/QuangTri/thanhdialavang/lavang2.jpg"
"788","Hang Tom Bridge","The old Hang Tom Bridge, once famous as the most beautiful suspension bridge in Northwest Vietnam, connected Muong Lay (Dien Bien) and Phong Tho, Sin Ho of Lai Chau. The bridge got its name from the abundance of shrimp in this stretch of the river. About 50m from the bridge, there was a very cool water spot where shrimp from the Da River would come to lay eggs, making the river thick with them. Locals would take turns catching them, but there was an unwritten rule that each household could only fish for about an hour before passing it on to the next house.|||The construction of Hang Tom Bridge started in the late 1960s with the help of Chinese experts and workers. However, in 1968, due to the Cultural Revolution in China, they withdrew, leaving only the completed cable-stayed parts.|||The bridge was finally inaugurated in 1973, marking a grand celebration for thousands of people from Northwest Vietnam.

Muong Thanh is now a protected historical site, preserved and restored as a tourist destination. After over 60 years, the bridge remains largely unchanged and forever linked to the term 'advance bridge'. Muong Thanh Bridge is a crucial military structure within the central stronghold of Dien Bien Phu province.|||On the morning of May 7, 1954, 34 soldiers from Company 360 bravely captured Muong Thanh Bridge. The battle was intense, with fierce fighting for every inch of land. Timely artillery support from DKZ 57 helped secure the victory, and the bridge was crossed to advance towards the enemy's stronghold. By 5 pm that day, soldiers from Regiment 209, Division 312, had arrived to cross the bridge and head straight into the enemy's command center.|||Within 30 minutes, General De Castrie and other enemy forces at Dien Bien Phu were captured alive. The sight of nearly 10,000 defeated soldiers waving white flags is unforgettable.|||Today, Muong Thanh Bridge no longer serves as a regular crossing but stands quietly on the gentle Nam Ron River, connecting historical moments with the present.

"791","Tham Vang Cave","From Dien Bien to Muong Ang, where a system of limestone mountains are scattered across the valley of Xuan Lao communal field, is also home to a deep cave called Tham Vang, which takes at least three hours by car to get there.|||Tham Vang cave is a new and unfamiliar name even to locals around Xuan Lao, Muong Ang. According to local descriptions, Tham Vang cave is a limestone cave system with an entrance at the mid-mountain slope. From there, you can descend into the depths, navigating through narrow passages and hazardous crevices to reach the Nam Hua stream that flows around the fields of Chieng Xom, Pha Hun, Mon Ha, and Chieng Lao villages.|||In the local Thai dialect, Tham means 'cave', while Bang or Vang means 'to leave'. Long ago, when couples in the area had marital problems, the husbands would leave their wives and take refuge in Tham Vang cave to cool off. The name Tham Vang cave was derived from the idea of couples separating. Due to its unflattering connotation and the challenging path to the cave, locals rarely visited this cave, as it might be misinterpreted that their family had marital issues.|||It's the rainy season, and a trip to a cave in the forest isn't exactly ideal, but I'm already here. When I arrived at Tham Vang Cave, the valley at the foot of the mountain was deserted and empty. The small trail leading to the foot of the mountain could only fit one person. The rain had left the path muddy and slippery. I walked for a while and finally reached a lush coffee farm, where I met Mr. Phan Nhat, the owner. When he heard I was heading to the cave, he kindly offered to guide me. I brought a machete and had a mix of excitement and nervousness as a traveler. The path became increasingly overgrown with grass, leaves, and debris after we left the coffee farm.|||The journey to Tham Vang now has another fearsome obstacle: la nang Hai. Fortunately, I had encountered this ""snack"" before in the caves of Phong Nha - Ke Bang, so I knew how to avoid it. La nang Hai looks dazzling, with a soft white downy covering on one side and a delicate green leaf on the other, growing to the size of an outstretched hand and covering the pathways. If you accidentally brush against it while trekking through the forest, the pain is like a burning fire. The initial wound appears as a slight red mark, then the itching starts, and the more you scratch, the more it spreads. The sensation of burning becomes unbearable, and it takes a couple of days to heal.|||Besides the deadly Nha Hai, the path to Tham Vang also boasts a swarm of mosquitoes as dense as the Yuan army. The climb is exhausting, but no one dares to stop for fear of becoming a target for the mosquitoes' grand feast.|||As you continue on, the vast cave entrance finally opens up before you. Fortunately, it's a dry cave, so the stalactites and limestone have been weathered, covered in moss and lichen, taking on mysterious shapes.|||Hanging from the cave ceiling, estimated to be over 50m high, are nearly a dozen giant bee nests, heavy with honey, swaying gently in the breeze.|||Phan Nhat says that every season when the bees are full of honey, the Thai people from the valley will bring bamboo and rattan, insert them into the rocky cliffs and climb up to collect honey. Looking at the steep cliffs, where some bamboo sticks from previous honey-gathering seasons still remain, I honestly can't imagine the dangerous work that involves risking one's life for the honey. With limited equipment, I ventured deeper into the cave, only about a hundred meters in, and all connection with the outside world was cut off, including the light. The darkness was immense, shrouded in mystery among ancient stone pillars that stretched from the cave ceiling to the floor, rugged and enigmatic. My guide, Phan Nhat, said that only about ten people in the area, all experienced climbers, are capable of navigating the entire cave.|||Standing from inside the cave looking out at the Xuan Lao field, one suddenly notices the familiar sight of Tham Vang with the entrance to Hang En cave (Quang Binh). Many geological structures in the cave such as rice terrace-like stalactites, sinkholes, and geological fractures ... are similar to the Phong Nha - Ke Bang cave system like Son Doong, Hang Tien, Hang Tu Lan ... The only difference is the eerie silence. The sound of mosquitoes buzzing, the echo of dripping water into the stone wall, and occasionally the lost cry of a swallow, while outside the cave, the evening light gradually fades, creating a scene that easily evokes feelings of loneliness and melancholy. Exploring the interesting nooks and crannies of Tham Vang, one only sees bats flying and the footprints of monkeys hiding in the cave, with no signs of local people who might have left their homes to live in the cave, perhaps reconsidering their decision, returning to their warm homes rather than befriending loneliness.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DIENBIEN/Hangthamvang/Hangthamvang1.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DIENBIEN/Hangthamvang/Hangthamvang2.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DIENBIEN/Hangthamvang/Hangthamvang3.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DIENBIEN/Hangthamvang/Hangthamvang4.jpg"

"794","Chiang So Tower","The Chiang So tower relic belongs to Na Muong village, Chiang So commune, Dien Bien Dong district, Dien Bien province. This is a unique architectural monument that demonstrates the solidarity and friendship between the people of Vietnam and Laos. According to legend, Vietnam and Laos are brotherly nations, and to prove their solidarity, the two nations together contributed to building a common spiritual work for the local people.|||To date, there is no specific historical document confirming the exact construction date of the tower, but research results indicate that it was built around the 15th-16th century.|||The Chiang So Tower is an architectural artwork that clearly demonstrates the ingenuity and artistic creativity of the people of Vietnam and Laos.|||The tower is architecturally designed in the shape of a wine pot, with a larger base and a smaller top.|||The tower stands at 10.5m high, with four sides around the base featuring two elephants at the front and two dogs at the back.|||The tower is constructed from bricks and mortar made from honey.|||The bricks used for construction come in two types: large, thick ones for the base and smaller, thinner ones for the upper parts and top of the tower.|||The base of the Tower is built in a square shape with multiple layers stacked on top of each other, making the tower's appearance more solid. The brick exterior is plastered with a layer of mortar, and there is no decorative pattern around it.|||The body of the Tower is decorated with intricate patterns, notably a six-tiered lotus flower supporting the tower, along with subtle carvings of animals, flowers, and leaves, arranged in a harmonious composition.|||The tower is also adorned with coiled dragons, their heads and tails meeting to form the number eight. These dragons have a distinctive pattern of scales, unlike any other depiction throughout Vietnamese history.|||They resemble small snakes, similar to those revered in Hindu culture.|||All these decorative elements are balanced around the tower to highlight its beauty, creating an attraction that captivates viewers of this architectural monument.|||From the main part of the tower up, it is built in a hexagonal tube-shaped architecture, surrounded by tangent lines and lotus petal patterns running continuously around the tower body. The entire tower body has 3 layers, each face of each layer is built and plastered flat in a hexagonal shape without decorative patterns, and the middle part of each layer is built to bulge out, resembling young lotus buds. The joints between each layer are decorated with patterns, which are stylized and pre-cast before being attached, such as lotus petals, spearheads, suns, and other floral patterns; inside the lotus petals and spearheads are small mirrors that reflect sunlight and emit a halo when the sun shines on them. The top layer (the tower spire) is decorated similarly to the lower layers, only differing in size, being smaller to create a soft and elegant appearance of the tower.|||Chiang So Tower holds many architectural, historical, and cultural values that still exist today. Firstly, it is an artifact of high artistic value in terms of architecture. The tower's design combined with intricate patterns shows that it is an ancient cultural heritage that embodies creative thinking, artistic intentions, and reflections on life of those who directly built the tower, as well as the people of the two Vietnamese and Lao nations in general.|||On the second day, Cheing So tower holds significant historical value as it helped researchers discover and confirm the long-standing solidarity between the Vietnamese and Lao nations.|||Thirdly, cultural value: with ingenious creativity, our ancestors have left for future generations a cultural heritage - a magnificent ancient Tower, which embodies the cultural beauty of Vietnam and Laos, jointly conceived and built. The existence of this Educational Tower inspires younger generations to look at the relic as if reflecting in a large mirror, witnessing the achievements of our forefathers' labor, with their passion, talent, and unity. All these efforts reveal the goal our ancestors aimed for: 'Truth - Goodness - Beauty'.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DIENBIEN/Thapchiengso/Thapchiengso01.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DIENBIEN/Thapchiengso/Thapchiengso02.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DIENBIEN/Thapchiengso/Thapchiengso03.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DIENBIEN/Thapchiengso/Thapchiengso04.jpg"

Muong Lay lies on both banks of the Da River, connected by long bridges, with the large hydroelectric lake creating a picturesque landscape. In the future, Muong Lay deserves to become a northern tourist hub of Dien Bien Province, an ideal stopover for the Northwest arc tour for all travelers.|||Since the Son La hydroelectric project was completed, the water level of the lake has risen about 213m, and the area of approximately 100ha has created an extremely attractive eco-tourism landscape for Muong Lay, with mountains above and a lake below, likened to a Ha Long on land.|||With the cool and fresh climate of the Northwest mountains and forests, Muong Lay is where the land and sky, mountains and rivers, past and present meet.

The most typical cultural aspect in Muong Lay is the culture of the White Thai people. Muong Lay is considered the stronghold of the White Thai people in Dien Bien, and is one of the cradles of the elegant dances such as the fan dance, bottle dance and hat dance that have become part of people's subconscious and poetry.|||To better understand the cultural identity and daily life of the locals, you can visit traditional craft villages such as weaving and fabric-making, ethnic musical instrument crafting in Na Lay ward, wood production and processing in Song Da ward, or rattan and bamboo weaving in Lay Nua commune.

Deep valleys below, which one can compare to our hatred...” Those immortal lyrics in the song “Hò kéo pháo” by composer Hoang Van, somehow recreated the difficulties of our army when pulling guns into battlefields during the historic Dien Bien Phu campaign 66 years ago. Today, the road where the guns were pulled has become a legendary one.|||Pha Din Pass was the most difficult starting point of the journey to pull guns by human power of Dien Bien soldiers back then. Starting from here, through many passes, slopes and deep valleys, the guns were pulled to the battlefields, so that the cannonballs were fired, heading to Him Lam outpost, Doc Lap hill, A1 hill, De Castries Bunker.... From Pha Din Pass to Dien Bien Phu, the road where guns were pulled can’t be measured by its physical length but by difficulties, hardships, dangers, sweat and blood.|||On that road, there was a special section, completed in just 20 hours, with a length of 15km, from Na Nham forest edge, through Pha Song peak at 1,150m high, down to Ban Tau, Ban Ngiu, now part of Na Nhann commune. On that section, our soldiers pulled guns weighing over 2 tons solely by human power, overcoming steep mountain slopes and treacherous high passes. It was on that route that hero To Vinh Dien used his own body to block the gun wheel, so that the gun wouldn’t roll down the deep valley.|||Overcoming countless hardships and difficulties, hundreds of guns and mortars eventually made it to the battlefields. And on March 13, 1954, they simultaneously fired at Him Lam resistant center, marking the beginning of the Dien Bien Phu battle.|||The road to pull guns into Dien Bien Phu battlefields has now become a legendary one.

This ancient pagoda has been ranked as a national historical site and is a popular spiritual tourist destination, attracting over 150,000 visitors annually to worship and pray.|||Huong Tich captivates people not only with its rare beauty but also as a sacred Buddhist site linked to the story of Princess Dieu Thien who practiced Buddhism and became a Buddha. According to legend, around 500 years before the Common Era, King Trang Vuong of the State of Chu had three daughters. When they grew up, the two elder sisters obeyed their father's will and married officials in the royal court. However, when it was the turn of the youngest princess, Dieu Thien, her father forced her to marry a cruel and ruthless military officer. Feeling desperate, she turned to Buddhism. The officer set fire to the temple but Dieu Thien and the monks were saved by Buddha's protection. Traveling south, Dieu Thien stopped at Huong Tich Cave, on Thieu Linh Mountain (now known as Hong Linh) in Viet Thuong land, and built a hermitage. She became renowned for her compassion and kindness. Meanwhile, King Trang Vuong fell seriously ill; the doctor advised that the king needed the eyes and hands of a volunteer to cure his disease. Hearing this, Dieu Thien showed compassion and donated her eyes and hands to save her father. When King Trang Vuong recovered, he sent someone to thank Dieu Thien but discovered it was his own daughter. Moved by Dieu Thien's heart, Buddha used magic to restore her eyes and hands. Dieu Thien achieved enlightenment and transformed into the Thousand-Eyed and Thousand-Handed Goddess of Mercy.|||According to historical records and archaeological research, as well as opinions of some scholars, the original Huong Tich Pagoda on Hong Linh mountain was built during the Tran dynasty, 13th century.|||The Huong Pagoda in former Ha Tay (now Hanoi) is a meaningful replica. According to the book Huong Son Thien Tru Thien Pha, a Buddhist monk was ordered by Lord Trinh to determine the site and build Huong Pagoda in Hanoi during the reign of Le Huy Tong under the name Chinh Hoa (1680-1704).|||Bui Van Nguyen, former General Secretary of the Vietnam National Documentation and Information Center, explained that during the Le - Trinh period, most Le kings and Trinh lords had their hometown in Thanh land.|||The imperial concubines and beauties were mostly chosen from Hoan Chau. Every year, the concubines and beauties from Thanh - Nghe often went to Huong Pagoda on Hong Linh mountain on the 18th day of the 2nd lunar month by boat through Hoi Thong gate.|||The long trips made Lord Trinh worried, so he decided to build a second Huong Tich Pagoda in Ha Son Binh to make it easier for them to visit.|||Thanks to Lord Trinh's initiative, Vietnam now has two Huong Tich Pagodas.|||The landscape and architecture of Huong Tich Pagoda, recorded in the 17th-19th centuries, no longer remain intact due to multiple fires.

Like other shrines in the Huong Tich complex, Thuong Pagoda was originally built in Trang Vuong cave above, but due to frequent fires, it was moved down to the middle of Huong Tich mountain. The pagoda is built in a north-south direction with two compartments. The inner compartment is used for Buddha worship with wooden Buddha statues. The outer compartment contains ceremonial objects and is where monks perform rituals and recite Buddhist scriptures. The Tam Bao houses 54 precious wooden statues created from the Tran - Le - Nguyen dynasties, arranged in rows, with many horizontal steles and couplets.|||From behind the temple, climbing about 28 stone steps leads to Huong Tich cave, also known as Quan Am or Phat Ba. The entire structure remains intact in its original form. Inside the cave, there is a deep cavern with a sitting statue of Quan The Am on a lotus throne and several statues of mother and child holding willow branches… The people consider Phat Ba Am a sacred place and it is here that Princess Dieu Thien practiced and became a Buddha.|||500m from the temple is an old stone foundation, commonly known as Trang Vuong. When Dieu Thien offered her eyes and hands to make medicine, King So Trang Vuong's illness was completely cured. Later, the king built Nganh Hong Temple to pray to heaven and earth, worship the Thousand-Handed and Thousand-Eyed Goddess of Mercy, and express gratitude to his filial youngest daughter.

The pagoda was then moved inside the dike, on the Tạu village land (in Xuan Pha village). The pagoda still faces southwest, towards the temple of Đại Hải Long Vương. The pagoda and the temple form a cultural complex in Trang Xuan Pho.|||At that time, most of the local people followed Buddhism, and the villagers avoided using the name of the village's tutelary deity (Long), so they called it Tau Pagoda. Every year, on major festivals such as the 8th day of the 4th lunar month, the birthday of Buddha Shakyamuni, monks, nuns, and Buddhists from the village and surrounding areas gather at Tau Pagoda to worship and pray. Buddhists from four streets of Tho Xuan, including Van An, Dong Nam, Tay Bac, and Khach (the Chinese street), also come to the pagoda to worship.|||Xuan Pha village has directly managed this pagoda for over 1000 years. Although many monks and nuns have come to cultivate at the pagoda, none have stayed until the end of their lives; it was not until after the August Revolution in 1945, around 1954, that Reverend Thich Thanh Cat from Co Phap village - Bac Ninh passed away at the pagoda.|||The stone stele in Chinese characters at the pagoda records: the T'au pagoda has undergone 7 restorations and renovations. These were in the following years: Binh Tuot Quang Hung (1586) by a general during the Le Trung Hung era, Hoai Vien Hau, also known as Thieu Chinh, who led the repair; the second time also by Thieu Chinh; the third time by local residents and devotees; the fourth time in 1925 when the Sanctuary of Saint Mother was built; in 1937 the Sanctuary of Saint Mother was renovated; in 1940 the Ancestor Buddha Hall was built; and in 1943 the entire pagoda was renovated, establishing a completely new place of worship as it is today.|||Overall, Tau Pagoda showcases a distinct architectural style from the late Nguyen Dynasty. The pagoda's structure follows the 'chui vo' or 'chu Dinh (T)' style, comprising a 5-room worship hall measuring 15m in length, 6m in width, and 90m2 in area; the architectural frame is of the 'gia chien' type. The rear sanctum is 3 rooms in size, 8.2m in length, 6m in width, and 49.2m2 in area. The pagoda is constructed from wood, bricks, and curved roof tiles. The front porch features 4 rows of Lim columns, with 3 columns in each row, and the rear sanctum has 4 columns, all made of stone; in total, there are 16 columns supporting the entire pagoda. The front porch has 6 frames, including single frames at both ends and 'gia chien' style frames; the frames adjacent to the front porch and rear sanctum are cast into 3 consecutive arches; the roof-supporting wood is solid. The horizontal beams and purlins are made of squared Lim wood; 3 lattice door frames consist of 12 wings that open and close in 3 rooms; the 2 front gables are built with flower-patterned walls. The eaves are 2m wide with 3-level stone and brick steps. On the 'dai bo' (roof ridge), two decorative 'con kim' are made of mortar and face each other. In front of the pagoda's yard, there are two square stone columns taller than the roof ridge, aligned with the two front gables; next to them is a stone plate engraved with the pagoda's renovation and the list of donors' names.|||Like other temples in the region, it primarily worships Buddha, featuring a system of statues of Shakyamuni Buddha, Amitabha Buddha, Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva, Maitreya, and Jade Emperor. On either side of the main hall, adjacent to the rear sanctum, there are statues of Long Thần, four Bodhisattvas, eight Vajras, two guardian deities protecting the temple, and a statue of the Patriarch who attained enlightenment at the temple. The temple currently preserves a 200kg bronze bell with a dragon-shaped handle, cast in 1943 during a major renovation of the entire temple.|||The temple features large inscriptions and couplets. The large inscription in the main hall reads ""cam ung dao gia"". The couplet in the main hall reads:|||Bao Pham Trung Hung Quang Phat temple|||The general family fortune certificate is a constant mind.|||In addition, there are two couplets at the two ends of the corridor; the couplet at the eastern end reads:|||May the three friendships and four gratitude inspire the soul to a peaceful dream|||The mystical door of the seven ancestral spirits has a serene soul emanating from it.|||The couplet on the west pediment reads:|||The heavenly sages' wisdom and virtues are eternal and complete|||Enjoy a peaceful and serene life for a hundred years.|||After the August 1945 revolution, due to the country's war situation, the temple's maintenance was nearly abandoned. After 1975, when peace was restored, Tho Xuan district allowed Tau Pagoda to revive its ceremonies. The People's Committee of Xuan Truong commune established a Management Board to take care of and prevent deterioration; from August 1984, they mobilized people to contribute to preliminary repairs, allowing the Buddhist temple to temporarily stabilize. In 2000, the government allocated funds to restore Tau Pagoda to its current state. In 2020, the provincial People's Committee issued Decision No. 47, recognizing Tau Pagoda in Xuan Truong commune, Tho Xuan district, Thanh Hoa province, as a cultural and historical tourism site.|||Proudly home to the TAu Pagoda and Xuan Pha communal house, recognized as National Cultural and Historical Relics; and Xuan Pha performance, a National Intangible Cultural Heritage, Xuan Truong commune continues to implement measures to preserve and promote the value of these precious relics and heritage, worthy of the tradition of the thousand-year cultural homeland of Xuan Pha - Xuan Truong.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/ThanhHoa/chuatau/chuatau.jpg"

The side that dug deeper in one night would win.|||On the night of the competition, the men worked hard but heard the roar of the waterfall from upstream.

It was recognized as a National Historic Site by the Ministry of Culture and Information in 1989 and ranked as a Special National Historic Site by the Prime Minister in 2012. Besides its archaeological, historical and architectural value, the relics in Go Thap are mostly spiritual and cultural works that worship national heroes, forefathers who reclaimed land and founded villages, and religious establishments. They all contribute to building the spiritual and cultural life of people in the Dong Thap Muoi region.|||Over the years, archaeological and historical research results have shown that Go Thap is a place of convergence of many outstanding values in archaeology, history, culture, ecology and most clearly expressed in spiritual cultural values through religious and belief monuments such as the Temple of Thien Ho Vo Duy Duong and the Temple of Doc Binh Nguyen Tan Kieu, which commemorates the great achievements of two national heroes who selflessly saved the country and led the patriotic army against the French (1862-1866). The battles organized by them have repeatedly made the French colonizers lose sleep, suffer heavy losses.|||This is a profound work, imbued with the traditional morality of ""drinking water, remembering its source"", aiming to remember the great merits of the ancestors who contributed to the country and educate the love for the country of Vietnamese people in the cause of anti-foreign aggression.|||Along with the relics of national heroes, in the complex of historical and cultural relics in Go Thap, there is also a shrine to Ba Chua Xu, bearing a strong imprint of folk beliefs. The Go Thap Ba Chua Xu shrine was built by local residents to worship Ba, the Mother of Dong Thap Muoi, to show respect for the female deity who gave birth and nurtured the people, providing them with food and clothing. This also serves as a place for people to visit and pay homage to Ba. Through this, it reflects people's aspirations for a prosperous life, abundant growth, and happiness, while demonstrating the traditional cultural values and ethics passed down through generations. Besides the worship of Ba Chua Xu, Go Thap also has a folk belief in worshiping Hoang Co. According to folklore, Hoang Co is the younger sister of King Gia Long. In the 18th century, Nguyen Anh went into exile in the South and occasionally hid in Go Thap. Hoang Co passed away here, was buried by the people, and a shrine was built in her honor. In addition to the temples and shrines, Go Thap also features the Linh Thap Pagoda, also known as the Ancient Pagoda. The pagoda was initially built by Vietnamese residents during the reign of King Thieu Tri (1841-1847) to worship Buddha and pray for peace and prosperity for the people. The pagoda was severely damaged during the war. After the South was liberated, in 1992, the Provincial People's Committee allowed the Ban Hoi Huong to mobilize the reconstruction of the pagoda into its current majestic form, providing a sacred place for Buddhists to worship and practice their faith.|||In parallel, every year at Go Thap Relic Site, there are two traditional festivals: the Via Ba Chua Xu ceremony on the 15th day of the 3rd lunar month and the memorial service for two national heroes, Thien Ho Vo Duy Duong and Doc Binh Nguyen Tan Kieu, on the 15th day of the 11th lunar month. The Go Thap Festival reflects a deep sense of gratitude to ancestors and spiritual beliefs. Through the festival, people express their aspirations and sincere wishes. The festival has become a traditional characteristic in Nam Bo. During the festival, the local people's lives become bustling and vibrant with visitors from everywhere coming to pray for wealth and fortune. They immerse themselves in the folk festival atmosphere, enjoying diverse cultural and artistic activities such as singing, dancing, folk games, and rich cultural performances. These activities help people forget their daily struggles and come together in a shared sense of direction towards goodness and beauty.|||Through the religious and spiritual relics in Go Thap, we can see the precious values of Go Thap land, which is a place of great sacrifice by national heroes during the resistance war against France. The land provides a bountiful harvest and national peace. There is a new belief in a prosperous life, happiness, and the assistance of Buddha... All of these have created a traditional cultural value in Go Thap, characteristic of the Dong Thap Muoi region and Southern Vietnam. Along with historical development, the spiritual cultural value through historical relics in Go Thap has been passed down from generation to generation, contributing to building precious moral values, raising awareness and responsibility of people in today's life.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DONGTHAP/KhuditichGoThap/DTQGDBGo-Thap-5.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DONGTHAP/KhuditichGoThap/DTQGDBGo-Thap-4.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DONGTHAP/KhuditichGoThap/DTQGDBGo-Thap-3.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DONGTHAP/KhuditichGoThap/DTQGDBGo-Thap-2.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DONGTHAP/KhuditichGoThap/Dong-Thap-Khu-di-tich-Go-Thap-2.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DONGTHAP/KhuditichGoThap/Dong-Thap-Khu-di-tich-Go-Thap-1.jpg"

"874","Dray Nur Waterfall","It is one of the symbols and pride of Dak Lak people. Dray Nur waterfall possesses majestic beauty with a romantic touch of the Central Highlands forest. Who comes once will remember, who meets once will love it…|||Located 25km from Buon Ma Thuot city on National Highway 14, winding roads take you through the mountains to the Buon Kuop hydroelectric dam and to the foot of Dray Nur waterfall.|||The scenery is vast and breathtaking on the way to conquer Dray Nur, with mountains on one side and lush green forests on the other, a truly mesmerizing sight.|||This is one of the rare waterfalls with a pair in Vietnam.|||It is accompanied by the romantic stories of the mountains and forests that have been passed down for thousands of years.|||Dray Nur is the pride of the people of Tay Nguyen. Those who travel far away will remember it, and those who return will love it. The sound of the waterfall pouring day and night like the strength of the great forest is majestic and wild.|||From a height of over 30m, Dray Nur waterfall pours down into the deep river, creating a magical natural scenery.|||Unlike other waterfalls on this plateau, Dray Nur Waterfall is associated with two different legends, with two completely different explanations of its name. According to one explanation, Dray Nur means the main waterfall, or the wife's waterfall, and is linked to a Romeo and Juliet-style love story of the mountains and forests.|||The story goes that a young couple from two different villages fell deeply in love, but their love was forbidden due to conflicts between the villages. Unable to find understanding from the villagers and reconcile the conflicts, one moonlit night, they jumped into the river to be together forever. Angered by the selfishness of the villagers that led to the young couple's tragic decision, a stormy weather erupted, and the river surged, splitting into two branches, separating the paths of the two families.|||Another legend originates from a cave behind the waterfall, believed to be the residence of King Thuy Te. The king's son, Nur, was a handsome prince who loved to travel and admire the scenery. One day, he met two princesses, the daughters of a king from a neighboring land. They were very beautiful but had become poor after their father's early death and were struggling to make ends meet by digging for roots to eat.|||Feeling sorry for their hardship, Nur accompanied them home, performed magic to fill their house with abundant rice, and lived happily with them. After some time, Nur missed his father and wanted to return to the underwater palace to visit him. However, his wife feared that if he left, he might not return for a long time, so she tried every way to keep him by her side. With no other option, Nur transformed into a golden mole, crossed the water screen to visit his father in the cave, while his wife waited outside, waiting and waiting but never seeing Nur return.|||From then on, the locals called this waterfall Dray Nur, which means the golden langur waterfall. Two different legends but the streams of water rushing from the vertical cliff, breaking into drops, splashing into each other, pushing each other of the waterfall are similar in one point, that is like the tears of crying for the people who leave.|||Dray Nur Waterfall is a middle course waterfall in a system of 3 waterfalls: Gia Long - Dray Nur - Dray Sap of the Serepôk river system, formed by the confluence of the Krong No river and the Krong Ana river.|||Around Dray Nur waterfall are small streams flowing gently through rocky outcrops. Occasionally, purple water hyacinths sway in the breeze. Visitors can explore the surroundings and then take a break to have lunch on the large rocks beside the waterfall or stop by the scattered huts along the way.|||Coming to Dray Nur Waterfall, the first feeling is a majestic waterfall with white foam, mist surrounding, making the scenery poetic. The waterfall is over 250m long, over 30m high, and 150m wide, spanning across Dak Lak and Dak Nong provinces.|||But the most appealing part is not admiring the waterfall, but exploring and seeking an adrenaline rush in the nearly 3,000m2 cave behind the waterfall. Watching the powerful water screen, pouring down from above, many people get goosebumps.|||Besides, the waterfall is special because behind the falling water is a large cave. So people can walk through the waterfall from one side to the other without getting wet. Standing inside the cave, looking out at the long wall of water, the dim light shines on the strange-shaped rocks. This is one of the unique experiences that only Dray Nur can offer to tourists exploring the vast and majestic Tay Nguyen, a place that once visited is remembered, and once encountered is cherished.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DakLak/ThacDrayNur/draynur1.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DakLak/ThacDrayNur/draynur2.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DakLak/ThacDrayNur/draynur3.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DakLak/ThacDrayNur/draynur4.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DakLak/ThacDrayNur/draynur5.jpg"

You will admire a mystical natural scenery with towering cliffs rising to the sky and a variety of flowers, butterflies, birds, and animals.|||This place is not only known for its picturesque waterfall but also associated with an ancient folk tale of the Ede people.|||The story goes that a long time ago, in an Ede village, there lived a young man named Dam Ji, who had an extraordinary appearance and a strong physique.|||He was skilled at hunting, and his sword was feared by all animals, but he had a hot temper and was very violent.|||If anyone disagreed with him, he would immediately punish them.|||Despite being very talented, Dam Ji was not respected by the people.|||On the contrary, his younger brother was kind and gentle, so he was loved and cherished by everyone.|||One day, the two brothers went into the forest to hunt, but they had not caught any animals and were thirsty.|||There was no water to drink in the forest.|||In desperation, Dam Ji, still holding his sword, got angry and swung it down to the ground.|||The earth shook, and a stream appeared before him.|||He was overjoyed and swung his sword six more times.|||Then, not far from the stream, rocks fell, and many animals panicked.|||Dam Ji saw another stream appear.|||From then on, in the forest where the young man often hunted, there were two streams: the western stream was named Ea Dah, and the eastern stream was named Ea Puk.|||However, these two streams have different characters, just like the Dam Ji brothers. The Ea Dah stream in the west has a strong and fierce character like the older brother. People in the region are afraid of its name. When coming here to catch fish or fetch water, they must be very careful not to be swept away by the stream. Children in the area often get swept away while bathing. If someone praises the stream for having a lot of fish, they will catch some. But if they say it has little or no fish, the stream will not yield any fish, and they will catch nothing even if they fish all day. When the stream gets angry, it will flood and sweep people away.|||On the other hand, the Ea Pu stream in the east is very gentle and harmless. Anyone who comes here to fish will leave with a basket full of fish. Therefore, people call Ea Pu stream the gentle stream. This stream is like the younger brother, kind, generous, and often helps others, unlike the fierce Ea Dah stream.|||Besides, Thuy Tien waterfall is also associated with a beautiful love story between a Vietnamese soldier and a beautiful E De ethnic girl. They bravely fought against the enemy until their last breath to protect their village and revolutionary base, contributing to the victory of the national resistance war against America.|||On March 3, 2009, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism decided to rank Thuy Tien waterfall as a national scenic site.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DakLak/ThacThuyTien/Thacthuytien01.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/DakLak/ThacThuyTien/Thacthuytien02.jpg"

The 722 hill is 722m above sea level in Tho Hoang 4 village, Dak Sak commune, Dak Mil district.|||In May 1965, the US - Ngụy and Saigon authorities built the 722 hill military base (also known as Duc Lap special forces camp) about 10 km east of Duc Lap district center to increase forces and military activities.|||To counter the enemy's plot, in 1968 the Politburo and the Western Highlands battlefront command decided to destroy the enemy at Duc Lap district military zone with the 722 hill - Dak Sak as the core, one of the key enemy strongholds in the Western Highlands. From 1968 to 1975, our main forces coordinated with local military and people to organize many attacks on this stronghold, wearing down the enemy's forces and destroying their fortified positions that were threatening the Ho Chi Minh trail in South Western Highlands.|||After 1968, through many heavy defeats in South Western Highlands, the enemy retreated to fortified strongholds, including 722 hill - Dak Sak. From here, they continued to implement forced relocation policies. In response, Quang Duc provincial party committee directed Dak Mil district party committee to overcome difficulties and implement 'three attachments' (cadres attached to people, people attached to land, and militia attached to enemy) to continue fighting against the enemy and building rear bases. By 1975, Dak Sak and Duc Lap strongholds were completely eliminated.|||After the liberation day, to commemorate the great sacrifice of our cadres and soldiers at 722 hill - Dak Sak, Dak Nong province built a memorial for heroes and martyrs. On October 24, 2012, 722 hill - Dak Sak relic was recognized as a national historical site by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism.|||This historical relic has great significance in educating young generations about tradition and political awareness, and honoring the great merit of our predecessors.
