1,Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy,"The Temple of Literature was built in 1070 (the second year of Than Vu era under King Ly Thanh Tong) to worship the early saints and masters of Confucianism, and also functioned as a Royal School, with the first student being Crown Prince Ly Can Duc, son of King Ly Thanh Tong. In 1076, King Ly Nhan Tong established the Imperial Academy next to the Temple of Literature as a school exclusively for the king's children and children of high-ranking mandarins in the court. In 1253, King Tran Thai Tong changed the Imperial Academy to Quoc Hoc Vien (Imperial College), expanding it to admit children of commoners with excellent academic abilities. During the reign of King Tran Minh Tong (1314 – 1329), educator Chu Van An was appointed Director of the Imperial Academy (principal) and direct teacher for the princes. In 1370, after his death, King Tran Nghe Tong had him worshipped at the Temple of Literature alongside Confucius. In 1785, King Le Hien Tong changed the Imperial Academy to Thai Hoc House. In the early Nguyen Dynasty, the Imperial Academy was established in Hue, and the Thai Hoc House was changed to Khai Thanh House. From the outside, the entire Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy complex is surrounded on all four sides by a brick wall built with large traditional bricks – a common architectural material during the Later Le Dynasty, creating an ancient, solemn, and nostalgic space. Inside the wall, ancient architectural roofs are hidden beneath the lush branches of old trees, making the place offer a scenery completely different from the outside, creating a special attraction for visitors. In front of the Temple of Literature, across Quoc Tu Giam Street, there is a fairly large lake called Literature Lake. Previously, in the middle of the lake was Kim Chau Islet, where a square pavilion - 'Phan Thuy Pavilion' - was built, which served as the venue for poetry appreciation sessions by Confucian scholars. The pavilion is now gone, but a stele erected in Tu Duc year 18 (1865) remains on the islet, recording the renovation of the Temple of Literature. Located within a large campus, the inner grounds of the Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy are divided into 5 areas, separated by ancient brick transverse walls. The first area starts from the Temple of Literature Gate to the Dai Trung Gate. Before entering the Temple of Literature Gate, visitors must pass through the outer ceremonial gate, which consists of four large brick pillars (the four main pillars). The two middle pillars are built higher, with two kneeling Nghê statues on top; the two outer pillars are lower, with sculpted phoenixes on top, their tails clustered together, and four heads facing four directions. The pillar bodies are embossed with pairs of Chinese couplets. On both sides of the ceremonial gate are two 'Dismount' steles. After passing the outer ceremonial gate, visitors will go straight to the Temple of Literature Gate (inner ceremonial gate), which consists of three arched gates, with the central gate built on two stories. The lower story is designed to be large and wide, with stairs leading to the upper story. The outside of the lower story only has one arched wooden door with two leaves; the semi-circular door lintel is carved with a pair of dragons adoring the moon. The upper story is smaller, designed as a two-story, eight-roofed ceremonial gate, including four eaves and four main roofs. This story has three arched gates, with bells and chimes hanging in the central gate, and a wide corridor with railings on all four sides. From the Temple of Literature Gate, following the straight paved brick path, visitors will arrive at the second gate, Dai Trung Gate, which consists of three chambers built on a high brick foundation, with a tiled roof and a structure of three rows of pillars. On both sides are two smaller gates, Thanh Duc Gate and Dai Tai Gate. The transverse wall connecting the three gates of Dai Trung Gate extends on both sides to the outer perimeter wall, together with the transverse wall at the Temple of Literature Gate, forming a square frame. Inside are many green trees and shade, giving visitors a sense of relaxation when strolling through this solemn, tranquil place. The paved brick path from the Temple of Literature Gate will continue to lead visitors to the second area, from Dai Trung Gate to Khue Van Pavilion. Built in 1805, Khue Van Pavilion is a square pavilion consisting of two stories and eight roofs. The lower story has four brick pillars, with all four sides left open. The upper story features wooden architecture, a tiled roof, four sides covered with wooden panels, and each side features a round window with balusters symbolizing the rays of the Khue constellation shining in the sky. On both sides of Khue Van Pavilion are two gates, Bi Van and Suc Van, names signifying praise for the beauty and value of literature. Khue Van Pavilion is considered a unique architectural work, a symbol of Vietnamese culture and literature. Passing through Khue Van Pavilion, visitors will reach the third area in the Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy relic complex: Thien Quang Well and the system of Doctors' Stelae. Thien Quang Well, also known as Van Tri (Literature Pond), is square-shaped and full of water all year round. The calm water surface becomes a mirror reflecting Khue Van Pavilion and the old trees, creating a shimmering, magical scenery. Ancient people believed that the square well symbolizes the Earth, and the round gate of Khue Van Pavilion symbolizes the Heaven. The quintessence of both Heaven and Earth is concentrated in this solemn cultural and educational center in the capital city. The paved brick path surrounding Thien Quang Well will lead visitors to the House of Doctors' Stelae, erected on both the left and right sides of the well. This is considered an important relic within the Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy complex, comprising 82 stone stelae carved with inscriptions listing the names of Vietnamese Confucian Doctors from the Court Examinations during the Later Le and Mac Dynasties (1442-1779). All stelae are crafted in the same style: flat, with curved tops, and an arched shape. The stelae are placed on the backs of stone turtles to symbolize the longevity of the nation's essence, reflecting the cultural and historical values of the country for over 300 years. This is an extremely valuable historical source, helping future generations research the lives and careers of many prominent figures of Vietnam. With its outstanding and rare values, in 2010, the 82 stone stelae from the doctoral examinations of the Later Le and Mac dynasties at the Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy were recognized as World Document Heritage under UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme. After visiting the House of Doctors' Stelae, through the Dai Thanh Gate, visitors will arrive at a large courtyard paved with Bat Trang bricks, marking the beginning of the fourth area, the main area of the Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy. On the left and right sides of the courtyard are the two wings, Ta Vu (Left Wing) and Huu Vu (Right Wing). Each wing has 9 chambers, built on a high foundation, with tiled roofs and roof ridges sculpted in 'bo dinh' style, featuring a 'chong ruong' style truss structure. Connecting to the gables of the two wings, Ta Vu and Huu Vu, forming a traditional U-shaped structure, is the Dai Bai (Great Worship) Hall. This was where, in spring and autumn, the king, royal relatives, and mandarins came to offer sacrifices to Confucius. The Dai Bai Hall consists of 9 chambers with 6 rows of pillars, built on a foundation 30cm higher than the courtyard surface, with a brick curb around the base and a roof covered with 'mui hai' tiles. The truss structures are in the 'chong ruong, con ke chong, bay hien' style. The central roof ridge is embossed with a pair of dragons adoring the moon, and the eaves are decorated with stylized floral patterns. Currently, only the central chamber of the Dai Bai Hall has an altar; the remaining chambers are empty. Around the altar, many horizontal lacquered boards and parallel sentences praising Confucianism and sages are hung. Parallel to the Dai Bai Hall at the back is the Dai Thanh (Great Achievement) Sanctuary, consisting of 9 chambers with three sides built with walls. The front has folding doors closing off 5 chambers, and the 4 gable-end chambers have fixed barred windows. The central chamber of the sanctuary houses a shrine and a large throne for Confucius. The fifth area in the Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy relic complex is the Thai Hoc House, formerly the Imperial Academy, a place for training talents for various dynasties. Over time and through historical upheavals, the old building was destroyed. In 1999, the Thai Hoc House was rebuilt with a grand architectural scale and in harmony with the landscape of the Temple of Literature in front. The Thai Hoc House has an interconnected structure, a roof covered with 'mui hai' tiles, roof trusses in the 'chong ruong, con chong ke, bay hien' style, and a floor paved with Bat Trang bricks. The rear worship palace is built with a double-tiered roof, covered with 'mui hai' tiles, and a truss structure in the 'chong ruong gia chieng' style. The final architectural part is the Front Hall and Rear Hall, rebuilt in 1999. The Front Hall has 9 chambers with 40 ironwood pillars supporting the roof, and gables built with brick walls. This is currently where documents showcasing the tradition of studiousness, respecting teachers and morality of Vietnamese generations are displayed. The Front Hall is connected to the Rear Hall via a connecting corridor, with two doors leading to the bell house and drum house. The Rear Hall is a two-story wooden structure. Its first story consists of 9 chambers and 2 wings with 72 ironwood pillars, serving as a place to honor the Esteemed Master, Director of the Imperial Academy Chu Van An – a world cultural figure and an eminent educator of Vietnam – and to display documents about the Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy as well as Vietnamese Confucian education. The second story is dedicated to worshipping the kings who contributed to building the Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy and to the nation's Confucian education, namely Kings Ly Thanh Tong, Ly Nhan Tong, and Le Thanh Tong. Currently, the Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy is also a venue for typical cultural activities such as scientific seminars, specialized exhibitions; honoring outstanding valedictorians graduating from universities and academies in Hanoi; awarding certificates for the academic ranks of Professor and Associate Professor; and annually organizing Book Fairs and Vietnam Poetry Day.",https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG18JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG17JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG16JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG15JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG14JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG13JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG12JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG11JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG10JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG09JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG08JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG07JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG06JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG05JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG04.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG03JPG.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG02.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/CSDLDLVN2019/HaNoi/VMQTGiam/VanmieuQTG01JPG.jpg
