"896","Visit the Southern Regional Headquarters Base","The historic site of the Southern Regional Headquarters Base lies north of Tây Ninh province, near the Vietnam‑Cambodia border, about 60 km from Tây Ninh town.|||The historic site is also known by several other names, such as R (the secret code name of the Southern Central Committee); Camp Chang Riệc (named after the forest area where the base was located); Camp Pham Hung (Comrade Pham Hung served as Secretary of the Central Committee for many years); Bac Tay Ninh Base. During both the anti-French and anti-American wars, the Southeast region overall and Tay Ninh in particular were strategic zones. The Bac Tay Ninh Base served as the headquarters of the Southern revolutionary leadership for a long period and directly directed the southern revolution until the South was fully liberated.|||The historical site of the Central Headquarters of the Southern Region consists of three zones: the Central Headquarters of the Southern Region, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (Viet Cong) Headquarters, and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam Headquarters.|||1. Southern Regional Headquarters Base|||In March 1951, the first Central Committee Conference (second term) decided to establish the Southern Region Central Office, appointing Comrade Le Duan as Secretary and Comrade Le Duc Tho as Deputy Secretary. Later, Comrade Le Duc Tho was appointed Secretary and Comrade Pham Hung became Deputy Secretary. On September 6, 1954, the Politburo dissolved the Southern Region Central Office and reestablished the Southern Provincial Party Committee and district committees.|||On 23 January 1961, the third meeting of the Party Central Committee's Executive Board (III term) decided to re-establish the Southern Regional Central Committee. In early 1965, the Central Committee was tasked with overseeing the Southern region and the far south of the Central region, and comrade Nguyen Van Linh, Secretary of the Southern Provincial Party Committee, assumed the role of Secretary of the Central Committee.|||During 1967–1975, Comrade Pham Hung served as Secretary; Comrades Nguyen Van Linh, Phan Van Dang and Hoang Van Thai served as Deputy Secretaries of the Central Office.|||The base was built in the Chàng Riệc forest of Rùm Đuôn, nestled within untouched primary forest with multiple canopy layers. The living quarters and work rooms are elevated above the ground; all posts, beams and braces are made of wood, and the roof is thatched with trung quan leaves. Underground shelters are typically placed next to the housing and work areas, sinking deep into the earth.|||Currently, this site is planned into two main zones:|||- Historic site: restored main residence, a large hall, a small hall, guard house, office, Hoang Cam kitchen, and the living and working quarters of comrades Nguyen Van Linh, Nguyen Chi Thanh, Vo Van Kiet, Pham Hung, among others. The combat trench network, including the distinctive frog-shaped trenches, runs continuously along the whole route.|||- The memorial complex includes a reception hall, exhibition area, and a shrine honoring heroic martyrs. The total built area of this zone is 750m2.|||2. Base of the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|||On December 20, 1960, at Trảng Chiêng in Tân Lập commune, Chau Thành district (now Tân Biên district, Tây Ninh province), the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam was founded and a provisional Central Committee was appointed. The Front later held a series of national congresses:|||The first National Liberation Front of South Vietnam Representative Congress (February 16 – March 3, 1962) and the second (November 11–18, 1964).|||- From 15 to 20 August 1967, in the North Tây Ninh base area, the irregular congress of the Front adopted a political program as the basis for establishing the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam. This was the third and final congress.|||This historic site is located along the Cho Stream and consists of three distinct functional zones:|||- The original historic site includes: the guard house, the liaison house, the guest house, the residences of comrades Nguyen Huu Tho, Phung Van Cung, Vo Chi Cong, the Hoang Cam kitchen, an assembly hall, and several sections of trench roads and shelter tunnels…;|||- The memorial complex includes a gatehouse, a reception hall, and an exhibition hall;|||- Protected area: integrated with the natural landscape.|||3. Provisional Revolutionary Government Headquarters of the Republic of South Vietnam|||From 6-8 June 1969, in the Tan Not forest of Chau Thanh district (now Tan Bien district, Tay Ninh province), the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam was formed. Architect Huynh Tan Phat served as its chairman, and lawyer Nguyen Huu Tho chaired the Advisory Council.|||The Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam headquarters, covering 60ha, is divided into three zones:|||- The original historic complex comprises the workhouse, dining hall, Hoang Cam kitchen, shelter bunker, and trench communications.|||- The complex includes a reception building, exhibition space, guest lounge, workroom, and a brewery;|||- Protected area: integrated with natural landscape.|||The historic site of the Southern Central Committee Base holds special significance. Over 15 years (1961-1975), the Central Committee turned many Party policies and President Ho Chi Minh’s directives into concrete actions in the South, issuing numerous directives and resolutions that shaped the revolutionary strategy across the southern battlefield. History shows that establishing the Southern Central Committee Base was a wise and innovative Party decision. The Base left valuable lessons on building strong bases, mobilizing the people in revolutionary movements, and especially on Party building.|||The Southern Central Headquarters, once the revolutionary capital of South Vietnam, preserves the traces and memories of a grueling, sacrificial yet proud revolutionary struggle. It bears witness to senior Party leaders, countless officials and soldiers who fought in the holy war to liberate the nation from American aggression, especially in the Southern battlefields. This historic site is not only vital for preserving tradition and education, but also an attractive destination for both domestic and international visitors, particularly Vietnam’s younger generations.|||Recognizing its special significance, on May 10, 2012 the Prime Minister classified the Southern Regional Central Headquarters site as a Special National Historical Monument (Decision No. 548/QD‑TTG).","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/TayNinh/Tay-Ninh--Tham-quan-can-cu-trung-uong-cuc-mien-Nam-2.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/TayNinh/Tay-Ninh--Tham-quan-can-cu-trung-uong-cuc-mien-Nam-1.jpg"
"897","Mat Tower","Mat Tower is recognized by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism as a historic-cultural site and is one of only three remaining ancient towers in southern Vietnam. The entire structure is built of brick and slab stone, with a sharply tapering summit that reaches an estimated height of 10 m from the ground.|||The bricks are stacked tightly, leaving almost no gaps, which is striking. The main wall faces east, while the other three sides turn toward west, south and north. The tower showcases the sophisticated craftsmanship of the ancient Óc Eo civilization.|||Rising from a raised mound in the middle of a field, the tower looks from a distance like a pen tip stretching upward. It is a worthwhile spot for visitors to explore.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/TayNinh/Tay-Ninh-Thap-Chop-Mat-3.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/TayNinh/Tay-Ninh-Thap-Chop-Mat-2.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/TayNinh/Tay-Ninh-Thap-Chop-Mat.jpg"
"898","Nha Mat Tourist Area","Nha Mat Tourist Area is the most famous attraction in Bac Lieu. It features a large artificial beach and a host of fun activities such as a soaring air ride, electric buggy rides, a 6D cinema, and a massage lounge. It promises to be the perfect spot to beat the sweltering summer heat for visitors.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BacLieu/KDL-NHA-MAT.png|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BacLieu/NHA-MAT-4.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BacLieu/KVC-NHA-MAT-3.png|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BacLieu/KVC-NHA-MAT-2.png|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/BacLieu/KVC-NHA-MAT-1.png"
"899","Tan Lap Floating Village","Tan Lap Floating Village lies deep within the flooded forests of the Mekong Delta’s Dong Thap Muoi region, a wetland ecosystem typical of southeastern Vietnam. Cajuput trees, lotus, water lilies, water caltrops and abundant wildlife such as storks and pangasius catfish give the area its own palette of colours. The plain of Long An offers simple, unpretentious scenery that soothes the soul.|||Tan Lap is an eco‑tourism destination in Tan Lap commune, Moc Hoa district, Long An province. The village is interlaced with the Rach Rung canal and the Vam Co Tay River.|||Beyond the floating houses, the site includes a natural reserve, a forest garden, a wildlife migration zone, a boat dock and more. That’s why a one‑day visit never feels boring – there’s always something new to explore.|||Because it is a flooded‑forest eco‑park surrounded by green cajuput woods, you can visit any season. However, for picture‑perfect moments, come during the flood season when plants and animals are at their most vibrant. Visiting outside this period offers little interest. Travelers are advised to go during the high‑water months, when the landscape resembles a miniature Mekong West, the hallmark of Tan Lap. The flood season runs from August to November (lunar calendar), coinciding with the central‑Vietnam rainy season.|||When the waters rise, many birds return to build nests and feed on the plentiful fish. This time also brings a bounty of riverine specialties. Lotus and water lily blossoms cover the village, providing spectacular photo opportunities.|||Tan Lap is ideal for nature lovers seeking peace. Entrance is 60,000 VND per person; boat rides with a guide cost an additional 30,000 VND per person. Boat operators double as guides, steering you through the vast marshes and lush vegetation. In October‑November, when lotus are in full bloom, boats can take you to the stunning lotus fields for unforgettable selfies.|||Tan Lap remains a relatively untouched destination, so culinary options are modest. Simple, rustic river‑front dishes are available, and visitors may bring their own food for a communal picnic. Still, trying the local village fare is part of the experience.","https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/LongAn/Long-An-Lang-noi-Tan-Lap-4.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/LongAn/Long-An-Lang-noi-Tan-Lap-3.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/LongAn/Long-An-Lang-noi-Tan-Lap-2.jpg|||https://csdl.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/uploads/images/01_3/CSDLDIEMDL2021/LongAn/Long-An-Lang-noi-Tan-Lap-1.jpg"
